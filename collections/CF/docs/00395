heat
prostration
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
we
wish
to
report
three
cases
of
hyponatraemic
dehydration
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
admitted
to
this
hospital
in
late
june
and
early
july
this
year
these
three
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
clearly
illustrate
the
danger
of
the
present
unusual
climatic
conditions
the
necessity
of
salt
supplementation
in
these
environmental
circumstances
should
be
emphasised
to
all
concerned
and
above
all
to
parents
the
danger
of
the
administration
of
salt
free
glucose
solutions
also
should
be
borne
in
mind
in
the
past
the
case
has
been
argued
for
a
safe
electrolyte
solution
that
would
be
commercially
available
in
the
absence
of
such
a
readily
available
form
of
electrolyte
glucose
solution
parents
will
need
explicit
instructions
on
how
the
salt
supplement
should
be
administered
