conjugates
of
cholic
chenodeoxycholic
deoxycholic

lithocholic
acids
by
radioimmunoassay
in
a
variety
of
pediatric

showed
elevations
in

syndromes
cholestasis

hepatitis
of
extrahepatic

origin
measurements
of
individual
serum

failed
to
differentiate
between
the
various
neonatal
hepatitis
syndromes
in

patient

cholestasis
the
increased

observed
returned
to
normal
following
therapy
with

the

values
correlated

these
data
confirm
suggestions
that
serum
cholylglycine
and
chenodeoxycholylglycine
levels
are
a
sensitive
indicator
of
disturbed

and
can
be
used
in

in

elevations
in

were
detected
without
associated
hyperbilirubinemia

provided
additional
