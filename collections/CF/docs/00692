cystic
fibrosis
in
black
children
we
feel
that
cystic
fibrosis
in
the
black
population
occurs
more
frequently
than
as
reported
by
kulcycki
and
schauf
our
experience
with
black
patients
does
not
indicate
that
their
course
and
prognosis
is
different
from
that
in
the
white
population
with
cystic
fibrosis
