cellular
metachromasia
with
toluidine
blue
o
in
cultured
white
cells
of
cystic
fibrosis
heterozygotes
we
examined
white
cell
cultures
from
parents
of
cf
patients
ie
compulsory
heterozygotes
to
confirm
if
possible
the
existence
of
an
ametachromatic
group
class
iii
and
the
quantitate
this
class
in
relation
to
the
numbers
of
heterozygotes
showing
vesicular
cytoplasmic
metachromasia
class
i
and
generalized
metachromasia
class
ii
leucocyte
cultures
from
the
cf
carriers
were
set
up
in
parallel
with
similar
cultures
from
normal
healthy
controls
the
results
confirm
the
value
of
the
toluidine
blue
o
metachromasia
phenomenon
in
white
cell
cultures
as
a
method
for
heterozygote
detection
in
cystic
fibrosis
and
suggest
that
it
may
be
justified
to
replace
the
tedious
expensive
and
time
consuming
fibroblast
technique
with
the
much
simpler
and
more
rapid
leukocyte
culture
procedure
the
simplicity
and
apparent
reliability
of
the
leukocyte
culture
procedure
as
outlined
here
should
facilitate
intrafamilial
investigation
and
co
ordination
of
metachromasia
class
with
other
parameters
such
as
sweat
electrolytes
ciliary
dyskinetic
factor
and
clinical
manifestations
such
a
study
if
it
revealed
distinct
and
consistent
phenotypic
correlations
might
furnish
valuable
additional
evidence
for
genetic
heterogeneity
in
cystic
fibrosis
