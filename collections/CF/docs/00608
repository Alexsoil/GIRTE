in

lymphocytes
from
adults
homozygous
or
heterozygous
for
cystic
fibrosis
show
biochemical
abnormalities
when
cultured
for
hours
in
the
presence
of
phytohemagglutinin
and
autologous
serum
in
contrast
to
the
per
cent
increase
in
total
protein
and
beta
glucuronidase
concentrations
seen
in
healthy
control
subjects
when
measured
per
cells
both
concentrations
decreased
by
per
cent
in
adults
heterozygous
for
cystic
fibrosis
and
by
per
cent
in
adults
homozygous
for
cystic
fibrosis
the
abnormal
response
of
the
lymphocytes
from
persons
with
cystic
fibrosis
was
due
to
a
serum
factor
and
not
to
any
intrinsic
abnormality
of
the
lymphocytes
an
abnormal
response
to
hytohemagglutinin
occurred
in
only
per
cent
of
healthy
control
subjects
but
in
per
cent
of
adults
homozygous
for
cystic
fibrosis
and
in
per
cent
of
adults
presumed
to
be
heterozygous
for
cystic
fibrosis
as
a
result
of
this
phenomenon
lymphocytic
beta
glucuronidase
concentrations
were
significantly
lower
than
normal
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
when
the
cells
were
cultured
with
phytohemagglutinin
and
autologous
serum
the
demonstration
of
this
phenomenon
in
both
homozygotes
and
presumed
heterozygotes
parents
suggests
a
relationship
to
the
genetic
defect
in
cystic
fibrosis
