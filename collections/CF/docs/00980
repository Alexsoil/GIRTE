mucopolysaccharides
in
bronchial
secretion
of
children
the
diseases
of
respiratory
system
are
nowadays
one
of
the
important
medical
economical
and
social
problems
of
modern
civilization
a
common
symptom
of
these
diseases
regardless
of
their
etiology
character
klinical
manifestation
and
morphological
findings
is
hypersecretion
of
bronchial
sputum
tracheobronchial
mucus
is
produced
by
mucous
bronchial
glands
and
goblet
cells
this
mucus
represents
at
physiological
condition
about
micrometer
thick
cover
on
mucous
of
nasopharynx
larynx
trachea
bronchi
up
to
terminal
bronchioles
protective
function
of
mucus
cover
resposes
in
mechanical
and
humoral
barrier
and
also
in
removing
the
inhaled
particles
and
their
transport
to
the
upper
part
of
the
respiratory
system
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
bronchial
secretion
has
an
important
role
in
protective
mechanism
and
in
thermal
and
water
exchange
of
respiratory
tract
this
secretion
is
not
sufficiently
scrutinized
mainly
of
children
yet
