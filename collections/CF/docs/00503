research
in
cystic
fibrosis
first
of
three
parts
this
review
describes
the
major
directions
in
cystic
fibrosis
research
in
the
last
nine
years
there
have
been
no
further
reports
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
native
african
negroes
it
has
been
generally
accepted
that
cystic
fibrosis
follows
simple
autosomal
recessive
transmission
it
is
difficult
however
to
explain
maintenance
of
a
lethal
gene
at
such
high
frequency
nothing
is
known
of
the
chromosomal
localization
of
the
trait
at
present
there
is
no
simple
and
reliable
method
of
heterozygote
detection
the
secretions
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
are
often
not
copious
but
exhibit
a
peculiar
rheologic
property
several
groups
have
emphasized
decreased
water
content
of
cystic
fibrosis
secretions
in
the
pathogenesis
of
the
disease
there
is
no
consistent
abnormality
of
glycoproteins
or
glycosaminoglycans
to
explain
why
mucus
secretions
precipitate
and
obstruct
the
organ
passages
