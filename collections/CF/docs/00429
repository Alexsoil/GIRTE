the
lung
in
cystic
fibrosis
a
quantitative
study
including
prevalence
of
pathologic
findings
among
different
age
groups
the
autopsies
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
were
reviewed
with
respect
to
pathologic
changes
in
the
lungs
and
their
respective
prevalence
among
different
age
groups
although
bronchitis
mucopurulent
plugging
and
bronchopneumonia
were
almost
universally
present
among
children
of
all
ages
epithelial
metaplasia
and
bronchiectasis
were
rarer
among
infants
and
progressively
more
prevalent
in
older
age
groups
emphysema
was
absent
in
patients
under
two
years
of
age
and
affected
per
cent
of
the
patients
two
to
six
years
of
age
and
per
cent
of
the
patients
older
than
six
years
but
was
never
of
a
severe
degree
by
the
point
count
method
pulmonary
hemorrhage
although
uncommon
was
usually
associated
with
prominent
arterial
vessels
in
walls
of
bronchiectatic
airways
quantitative
assessment
of
bronchial
glands
revealed
reid
indices
significantly
higher
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
when
compared
to
noncystic
fibrosis
patients
but
there
was
no
increase
in
these
indices
with
the
age
of
the
patients
glandular
hypertrophy
predominance
of
mucous
acini
within
glands
and
goblet
cell
hyperplasia
of
the
bronchial
mucosa
all
suggest
an
explanation
for
the
copious
mucous
secretion
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
however
it
was
not
possible
to
ascertain
whether
these
findings
reflect
a
general
exocrine
defect
of
such
patients
or
whether
they
were
merely
a
response
to
chronic
airway
infection
even
though
the
latter
is
a
more
plausible
assumption
