immunochemical
method
for
detection
of
albumin
in
human
meconium
a
simple
immunochemical
technique
utilizing
single
radial
immunodiffusion
for
the
demonstration
of
albumin
in
human
meconium
is
described
a
comparison
of
this
technique
with
the
more
widely
used
sulphosalicylic
acid
precipitation
method
is
reported
we
also
have
attempted
to
determine
the
normal
levels
of
albumin
in
meconium
