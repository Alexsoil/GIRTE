cf
patients
of
whom
had
multilobular
cirrhosis
were
observed
regularly
for
a
period
of
years
and
various
liver
function
tests
indicating
cytolysis
cholestasis
and
cellular
insufficiency
were
performed
immunoglobulin
and
prothrombin
were
assayed
in
patients
with
cirrhosis
the
tests
were
generally
abnormal
two
distinct
biochemical
patterns
of
cirrhosis
were
distinguished
one
clearly
cholestatic
and
the
other
of
a
more
cellular
type
the
distinction
was
made
on
the
basis
of
the
iga
transferrin
ratio
and
of
gamma
glutamyl
transpeptidase
levels
in
the
non
cirrhotic
patients
a

increase
of
cytolysis
and

was
