brain
abscess
and
cystic
fibrosis
brain
abscess
has
only
recently
been
considered
a
complication
of
cystic
fibrosis
three
patients
are
reported
here
and
a
fourth
cited
from
the
literature
all
of
our
patients
were
young
adults
with
advanced
pulmonary
disease
the
bacteria
involved
were
mouth
organisms
and
were
found
in
the
sputum
culture
in
only
one
of
the
patients
resistance
was
present
to
previously
given
antibiotics
as
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
survive
into
adulthood
the
risk
of
developing
a
brain
abscess
appears
to
increase
