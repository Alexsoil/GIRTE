cystic
fibrosis
the
effect
of
medium
from
cultured
cystic
fibrosis
fibroblasts
on
atpase
activity
culture
medium
from
fibroblasts
of
cystic
fibrosis
patients
and
controls
was
examined
for
the
ability
to
inhibit
calcium
plus
magnesium
activated
atpase
and
sodium
plus
potassium
activated
atpase
the
atpase
systems
used
were
both
a
solubilised
preparation
from
dog
fish
and
a
membrane
associated
preparation
from
human
erythrocyes
contrary
to
other
reports
the
medium
from
cystic
fibrosis
fibroblasts
did
not
inhibit
atpase
activity
