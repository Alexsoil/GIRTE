intelligence

in
children
with

who
have
had
an
episode
of
malnutrition
during
infancy
in
this
study
we
have
compared
two
groups
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
one
group
of
cf
children
had
severe
malnutrition
in
the
first
year
of
life
whereas
the
second
group
of
cf
children
had
not
been
malnourished
the
catch
up
growth
experienced
by
both
the
control
and
malnourished
groups
was
impressive
and
was
generally
complete
in
terms
of
height
and
weight
for
age
this
finding
is
consistent
with
other
reports
regarding
catch
up
growth
following
malnutrition
associated
with
celiac
disease
anorexia
nervosa
renal
acidosis
cushing
syndrome
and
hypothyroidism
though
the
malnourished
group
tended
to
have
lower
iq
and
school
performance
scores
the
differences
were
not
statistically
significant
except
for
backward
digit
span
that
difference
may
indicate
an
organic
impairment
due
to
malnutrition
or
to
any
of
several
other
factors
our
data
fail
to
demonstrate
any
permanent
or
devastating
effect
of
early
malnutrition
during
a
very
