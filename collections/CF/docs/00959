salivary
amylase
in
cystic
fibrosis
a
marker
of
disordered
autonomic
function
total
serum
amylase
was
determined
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
of
whom
had
no
steatorrhea
control
patients
and
patients
with
shwachman
s
syndrome
patients
with
cf
who
had
steatorrhea
and
therefore
lacked
pancreatic
function
had
the
same
serum
levels
pre
and
postprandially
as
the
control
subjects
whereas
patients
without
steatorrhea
and
therefore
with
evidence
of
pancreatic
function
had
significantly
higher
levels
the
patients
with
shwachman
s
syndrome
had
significantly
lower
total
serum
amylase
than
the
three
other
patient
groups
only
the
patients
with
shwachman
s
syndrome
demonstrated
a
significant
postprandial
rise
in
activity
only
the
salivary
isoenzyme
was
detected
in
patients
with
shwachman
s
syndrome
or
cf
and
apparently
absent
pancreatic
function
whereas
cf
patients
without
steatorrhea
had
both
salivary
and
pancreatic
isoenzymes
these
results
demonstrate
that
patients
with
cf
have
an
increase
in
circulating
salivary
amylase
isoenzyme
whereas
patients
with
shwachman
s
syndrome
do
not
the
increase
probably
reflects
an
autonomic
hyperstimulation
of
salivary
secretion
which
is
primary
to
cf
and
unrelated
to
the
state
of
pancreatic
activity
