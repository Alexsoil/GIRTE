screening
for
cystic
fibrosis
in
the
newborn
by
meconium
analysis
during
a
year
routine
screening
programme
for
cystic
fibrosis
cf
specimens
were
examined
for
raised
meconium
albumin
levels
by
a
test
strip
method
and
by
electroimmunoassay
the
incidence
of
false
positive
results
was
about
per
specimens
in
either
test
this
could
be
reduced
by
by
determining
the
ratio
of
albumin
alpha
trypsin
inhibitor
a
ratio
below
being
considered
as
a
negative
result
and
it
could
be
reduced
to
zero
by
determining
the
ratio
in
subsequent
faecal
specimens
three
of
meconium
specimens
from
infants
with
proved
cf
gave
false
negative
results
in
all
tests
the
other
specimens
had
greater
than
mg
albumin
g
dry
weight
and
albumin
alpha
trypsin
inhibitor
ratios
of
greater
than
in
subsequent
faecal
specimens
the
ratios
were
over
meconium
specimens
from
elsewhere
in
the
uk
were
examined
and
these
included
from
infants
who
were
subsequently
proved
to
have
cf
six
of
these
cf
specimens
gave
false
negative
results
the
other
being
strongly
positive
the
origins
of
meconium
serum
protein
suggest
that
infants
with
cf
in
whom
meconium
gives
false
negative
results
have
normal
pancreatic
functions
at
birth
the
specificity
of
current
meconium
tests
therefore
cannot
be
improved
as
they
depend
on
pancreatic
dysfunction
