mg

was
determined
in
membrane
preparations
of
fibroblasts
grown
from
skin
biopsies
of
cystic

patients
and
age

controls
this
enzyme
was
stimulated
by
increasing
free
calcium
concentrations
with
an
apparent
kdiss
for
calcium
of
approximately
micron
although
there
was
a
great
deal
of
variation
in
ca
atpase

observed
between
individual
strains
there
was
a
significant
decrease
in
the
maximal
activation
of
the
ca
atpase
in
membrane
preparations
of

obtained
from
cystic

patients
compared

p
less
than
this
observation
indicates
that
decreased
ca
atpase
activity
is
a
generalized
phenomenon
in
cystic

found
in
more
than
one
cell
type
this
decrease
in
ca

may
have
a
number
of
implications

may
