nitrogen
balance
trials
with
cystic
fibrosis
patients
preliminary
nitrogen
balance
trials
have
been
carried
out
with
six
patients
known
to
have
pancreatic
insufficiency
to
investigate
the
utilisation
of
protein
from
a
general
diet
protein
from
a
general
diet
plus
exogenous
pancreatic
extract
and
pre
digested
protein
comprising
of
dietary
nitrogen
intake
in
the
absence
of
a
pancreatic
supplement
in
all
cases
the
addition
of
pancreatic
supplement
to
the
general
diet
improved
protein
digestibility
and
utilisation
substituting
of
the
dietary
protein
with
the
enzymic
casein
hydrolysate
resulted
in
further
improvement
in
nitrogen
balance
but
not
digestibility
for
five
of
the
patients
urinary
nitrogen
levels
of
the
casein
hydrolysate
diet
tended
to
be
lower
which
accounts
for
the
finding
above
with
the
acid
hydrolysed
protein
urinary
nitrogen
was
higher
when
compared
with
the
excretion
from
the
partial
casein
hydrolysate
and
provided
smaller
positive
nitrogen
balances
these
preliminary
findings
indicate
that
for
some
patients
with
pancreatic
insufficiency
partial
hydrolysates
have
greater
potential
for
nitrogen
retention
than
the
administration
of
exogenous
pancreatic
extracts
with
intact
protein
it
is
suggested
that
a
daily
supplement
of
pre
digested
protein
might
be
advantageous
for
ch
children
to
ensure
that
minimum
protein
requirements
are
met
