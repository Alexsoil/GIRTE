empyema

staphylococcal
empyema
is
not
a
rare
occurrence
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
occurring
in
as
many
as
per
cent
of
such
patients
in
our
recent
experience
in
some
patients
it
may
be
the
presenting
illness
in
infancy
cystic
fibrosis
patients
with
empyema
now
constitute
a
significant
percentage
approximately
to
per
cent
of
the
total
number
of
patients
hospitalized
with
empyema
since
most
of
these
empyemas
occur
in
infancy
and
most
are
of
staphylococcal
origin
sweat
tests
should
be
done
on
all
infants
admitted
with
staphylococcal
pneumonia
with
or
without
empyema
particularly
when
recovery
with
adequate
treatment
is
unduly
prolonged
