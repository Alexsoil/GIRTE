physical
properties
of
bronchial
secretion
the
weissenberg
rheogoniometer
is
designed
to
estimate
viscosity
at
a
single
applied
shear
by
varying
this
shear
the
associated
detailed
variation
of
viscosity
may
be
studied
the
level
of
viscosity
depends
more
on
the
macroscopic
appearance
of
the
sample
than
the
disease
with
which
it
may
be
associated
this
has
particular
significance
in
relation
to
cystic
fibrosis
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
sputum
viscosity
is
not
abnormally
high
it
is
not
higher
than
that
of
macroscopically
similar
sputum
from
chronic
bronchitis
or
asthma
whatever
the
feature
differentiating
cystic
fibrosis
from
other
diseases
it
is
not
the
viscosity
of
the
sputum
