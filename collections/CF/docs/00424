was
while
that
of
six
without
clinical
evidence
of
pancreatic
disease
did
not
differ
from
values
in

there
was
a
good
correlation

the
degree

ba
and
fat
sequestration
concomitant
changes
in
bile
acid
and
fat
loss
were
observed
in
the
one
group
of
six
patients
studied
on
and
off
pancreatic
enzymes
as
well
as
in
a
second
group
of
seven
children
treated
with
pancreatic
supplements
and
maintained
on
a
normal
diet

a
low

diet
supplemented

medium

administration

a

leads

that
the
percentage
of
primary

followed

excreted

in
situations
where
antibiotics
were
administered
the
exact
mechanism
for
the
increased
loss
of
ba
in
cf
is
unknown
it
is
found
in
all
age
groups
and
is
related
to
the
presence
and
degree
of
pancreatic
insufficiency
the
possibility
that
unhydrolysed
triglycerides
may
interfere
with
the
intestinal
absorption
of

needs
further
confirmation
