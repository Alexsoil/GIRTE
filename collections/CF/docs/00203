genetic
screening
the
recent
proliferation
of
genetic
knowledge
has
been
accompanied
by
speculation
about
its
uses
in
the
pursuit
of
both
medical
and
social
goals
as
well
as
by
fear
and
concern
about
possible
misuses
these
speculations
have
appeared
in
the
proceedings
of
numerous
symposia
and
in
many
books
and
papers
a
review
of
this
literature
reveals
that
the
nonmedical
participants
in
this
debate
were
preoccupied
with
those
aims
of
genetics
that
might
benefit
or
threaten
society
while
the
physicians
were
concerned
with
the
accomplishment
of
standard
medical
missions
in
which
social
aims
figure
only
incidentally
these
missions
are
diagnosis
management
and
prevention
of
disease
the
specific
uses
of
genetic
knowledge
most
frequently
mentioned
were
advances
in
the
taxonomy
of
disease
that
lead
to
improvements
in
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
individual
patients
and
their
relatives
genetic
counseling
and
genetic
screening
the
latter
two
particularly
screening
are
preventive
and
represent
the
interface
between
medical
genetics
especially
population
genetics
and
society
this
review
focuses
on
developments
in
genetic
screening
defined
as
the
search
in
a
population
generally
for
medical
reasons
for
individuals
possessing
particular
genotypes
