the

development
adaptation
and
malfunction
in
infancy
and
childhood
pancreatic
development
begins
during
the
fourth
week
of
gestation
in
annular
pancreas
the
ventral
pancreas
fails
to
migrate
to
the
right
of
the
duodenum
duplication
of
the
pancreatic
ducts
is
a
rare
entity
probably
arising
from
accidental
misplacement
of
mucosal
cells
from
the
duodenum
or
stomach
during
the
development
of
the
pancreatic
pouches
congenital
pancreatic
cysts
may
be
single
multiple
unilocular
or
multilocular
and
can
be
associated
with
polycystic
disease
of
the
kidney
liver
or
spleen
ectopic
pancreas
occurs
before
or
during
the
rotation
of
the
ventral
pancreas
and
its
fusion
with
the
dorsal
pancreas
few
tumours
of
the
pancreas
have
been
reported
in
children
less
than
years
of
age
the
evaluation
of
patients
via
different
pancreatic
function
tests
is
significant
only
when
the
results
are
interpreted
in
the
light
of
clinical
manifestations
tests
of
exocrine
pancreatic
function
in
childhood
include
stool
examination
the
triolein
test
blood
examination
analysis
of
duodenal
contents
the
secretin
pancreozymin
test
pancreatic
scanning
with
selenomethionine
transduodenal
pancreatogram
abdominal
ultrasound
and
arteriography
and
upper
gastrointestinal
x
ray
the
most
prevalent
disorder
of
the
pancreas
in
infancy
and
childhood
is
exocrine
pancreatic
insufficiency
well
over
per
cent
of
infants
and
children
with
pancreatic
insufficiency
have
cystic
fibrosis
shwachman
syndrome
is
the
second
most
common
cause
of
pancreatic
insufficiency
and
is
associated
with
neutropenia
metaphyseal
dystosis
sever
stunting
of
growth
eczema
and
susceptibility
to
infections
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
who
have
partial
pancreatic
insufficiency
sometimes
show
dissociation
of
different
enzyme
activities
although
pancreatitis
is
comparatively
rare
in
infancy
and
childhood
we
suspect
that
it
is
often
overlooked
