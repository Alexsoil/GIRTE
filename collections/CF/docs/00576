review
of
the
growth
characteristics
of
cystic
fibrosis
and
normal
human
diploid
fibroblasts
in
vitro
the
growth
kinetics
of
human
diploid
skin
fibroblasts
derived
from
cystic
fibrosis
cf
homozygotes
cf
heterozygotes
and
normal
individuals
was
determined
the
population
doubling
times
increased
with
time
in
culture
and
no
difference
was
observed
between
the
genotypes
tested
the
cell
cycle
times
remained
constant
through
the
th
subculture
while
the
growth
fraction
or
fraction
of
cells
in
the
cell
cycle
decreased
with
culture
time
however
changes
in
the
growth
fraction
and
population
doubling
time
appear
to
be
related
to
cellular
senescence
in
vitro
rather
than
to
cystic
fibrosis
