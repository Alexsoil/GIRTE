skin
wrinkling
in
cystic
fibrosis
it
had
been
noticed
that
in
cases
of
cystic
fibrosis
the
palmar
skin
of
the
fingers
and
the
plantar
skin
of
the
toes
wrinkled
very
quickly
when
immersed
in
water
almost
without
exception
the
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
had
noticeable
wrinkling
of
the
fingers
within
min
of
immersion
in
hand
hot
water
whereas
normal
children
showed
no
or
minimal
wrinkling
after
min
this
wrinkling
is
due
to
an
excess
of
salt
in
the
skin
which
increases
water
binding
capacity
of
keratin
the
test
would
thus
appear
to
provide
a
simple
and
cheap
screening
method
for
cystic
fibrosis
but
one
that
may
not
be
absolutely
reliable
