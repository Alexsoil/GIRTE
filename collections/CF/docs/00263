alpha
feto
protein
during
development
and
in
disease
an
alpha
feto
protein
afp
is
present
in
many
mammals
in
birds
and
in
sharks
during
development
the
afp
present
in
different
species
have
similar
physicochemical
properties
and
often
have
common
antigenic
determinants
their
study
both
in
health
and
disease
has
provided
a
useful
model
for
the
understanding
of
other
phase
specific
antigens
and
the
activation
of
the
genes
which
control
their
synthesis
in
the
human
fetus
the
level
of
afp
falls
with
increasing
maturity
the
more
sensitive
methods
of
detection
have
disclosed
that
this
fetal
protein
persists
in
trace
amounts
throughout
life
and
its
level
increases
in
maternal
blood
during
pregnancy
the
principal
sites
of
synthesis
are
the
fetal
liver
and
in
some
mammals
the
yolk
sac
splanchnopleur
in
humans
as
well
as
in
mice
and
cows
it
is
notable
that
the
synthesis
of
afp
is
increased
in
liver
cancer
cells
and
that
high
levels
of
this
protein
are
present
in
serum
elevated
values
of
afp
have
also
been
detected
in
human
subjects
with
undifferentiated
tumours
of
the
testis
and
ovary
a
fall
to
normal
levels
has
been
noted
in
cases
of
complete
remission
after
surgery
and
a
return
to
high
levels
in
patients
who
develop
metastases
in
some
patients
with
hepatitis
a
temporary
rise
in
the
level
of
afp
has
also
been
observed
in
recent
years
the
detection
of
high
levels
of
afp
in
amniotic
fluid
has
proved
to
be
of
great
value
for
the
prenatal
diagnosis
of
neural
tube
defects
abnormal
levels
have
also
been
found
in
the
amniotic
fluid
or
in
maternal
serum
in
cases
of
spontaneous
abortion
such
measurements
are
now
being
assessed
as
a
method
of
monitoring
abnormal
pregnancy
