possible
hazard
of
timed
release
aspirin
in
a
patient
with
pancreatic
insufficiency
an
episode
of
severe
small
intestinal
hemorrhage
occurred
in
a
cystic
fibrosis
patient
having
pancreatic
insufficiency
and
receiving
timed
release
aspirin
therapy
for
disabling
hypertrophic
pulmonary
osteoarthropathy
the
increased
acidity
of
small
intestinal
contents
due
to
decreased
bicarbonate
secretion
observed
in
patients
with
pancreatic
insufficiency
may
alter
the
luminal
environment
and
result
in
mucosal
erosions
and
or
ulcerations
in
association
with
the
presence
of
aspirin
thus
physicians
should
be
aware
of
the
possibility
that
timed
release
aspirin
causes
small
intestinal
hemorrhage
in
such
patients
