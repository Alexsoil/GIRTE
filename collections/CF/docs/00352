cystic
fibrosis
and
absence
of
vas
deferens
infertility
and
abnormalities
of
the
mesonephric
derivatives
are
common
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
but
it
is
not
a
uniform
finding
taussig
et
al
reported
on
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
who
had
proved
fertility
abnormalities
of
the
vas
could
be
documented
in
pathologic
studies
but
the
vas
was
found
to
be
present
in
some
patients
who
died
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
many
patients
absence
could
not
be
ruled
out
on
physical
examination
in
healthy
young
children
the
vas
is
not
easily
palpable
even
when
it
is
the
degree
of
certainty
in
its
identification
is
less
than
in
the
post
pubertal
male
cystic
fibrosis
is
a
disease
with
protean
manifestations
and
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
rule
out
cystic
fibrosis
just
because
the
vas
can
be
palpated
or
to
have
victims
of
cystic
fibrosis
labeled
as
infertile
