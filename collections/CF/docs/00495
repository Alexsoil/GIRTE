adenosine
cyclic
amp
in
fibroblasts
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
its
relationship
to
secretion
because
of
the
known
involvement
of
cyclic
amp
in
the
control
of
secretion
in
exocrine
and
other
mammalian
cells
we
have
studied
cyclic
amp
metabolism
in
cultured
cystic
fibrosis
cells
in
the
hopes
of
demonstrating
such
an
abnormality
a
detailed
comparison
of
cf
and
control
strains
showed
that
the
cf
cells
synthesized
times
more
intracellular
cyclic
amp
than
controls
in
this
paper
we
present
data
on
an
additional
cf
and
control
strains
measurement
of
intracellular
cyclic
amp
did
not
provide
the
same
clear
cut
differences
between
the
cf
and
control
strains
as
we
had
previously
observed
the
cf
strains
synthesized
more
cyclic
amp
than
controls
but
the
difference
was
not
as
large
as
in
our
earlier
study
and
there
is
considerable
overlap
between
the
two
groups
it
is
not
clear
why
these
two
studies
should
have
yielded
such
disparate
results
