endogenous
and
exogenous
insulin
responses
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
eight
male
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
normal
nutrition
normal
physical
activity
relatively
mild
pulmonary
disease
no
evidence
of
liver
disease
and
no
family
history
of
diabetes
mellitus
underwent
a
series
of
carbohydrate
tolerance
tests
in
comparison
with
a
group
of
normal
male
subjects
matched
for
age
and
body
weight
compared
with
the
normal
group
the
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
had
significantly
impaired
glucose
tolerance
and
significantly
lower
serum
immunoreactive
insulin
levels
during
oral
and
intravenous
glucose
tolerance
tests
serum
insulin
levels
were
also
significantly
lower
after
intravenous
administration
of
tolbutamide
in
the
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
but
the
reduction
in
blood
glucose
concentration
in
each
group
was
not
significantly
different
during
an
intravenous
insulin
test
the
decrease
in
blood
glucose
concentration
was
the
same
for
both
groups
in
spite
of
significantly
lower
serum
insulin
levels
in
the
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
percentage
fall
in
plasma
free
fatty
acids
was
at
least
as
great
in
the
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
as
in
normals
during
the
test
procedures
while
a
significant
decrease
in
plasma
alpha
amino
nitrogen
after
intravenously
administered
insulin
was
seen
only
in
the
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
these
studies
suggest
that
the
carbohydrate
intolerance
of
cystic
fibrosis
is
consequent
upon
an
impaired
insulin
response
to
glucose
but
that
this
insulin
deficiency
is
partly
compensated
for
by
increased
peripheral
tissue
sensitivity
to
insulin
