effects
of
chest
physiotherapy
on
lung

tests
in
children

cystic

chest
physiotherapy
is
an
important
part
of
the
treatment
program
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
but
controlled
studies
of
its
effects
are
few
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
being
chronic
sputum
producers
and
non
sputum
producers
were
studied
in
hospital
with
serial
lung
function
tests
on
consecutive
days
on
the
st
day
physiotherapy
was
performed
twice
on
the
nd
day
no
physiotherapy
was
performed
on
the
rd
day
the
two
periods
of
physiotherapy
were
preceded
by
an
inhaled
bronchodilator
rimiterol
lung
function
tests
included
peak
flow
forced
vital
capacity
fvc
forced
expiratory
volume
in
sec
fev
and
residual
volume
to
total
lung
capacity
ratio
and
were
measured
at
the
beginning
of
each
day
and
at
similar
intervals
throughout
the
days
sputum
volume
and
cough
frequency
were
noted
on
day
and
day
physiotherapy
resulted
in
significant
improvement
of
peak
flow
in
the
sputum
producers
however
the
fvc
and
fev
while
improving
after
physiotherapy
also
improved
on
the
control
day
when
no
physiotherapy
was
performed
this
suggests
that
physiotherapy
may
be
effective
in
removing
sputum
from
central
large
airways
with
resultant
improvement
in
peak
flow
but
has
little
added
effect
on
the
more
peripheral
airways
whose
airflow
improves
through
the
day
with
normal
activity
no
significant
effect
was
shown
in
the
non
sputum
producers
although
there
was
a
trend
towards
improvement
in
peak
flow
a
bronchodilator
before
physiotherapy
may
be
beneficial
in
those
patients
who
demonstrate
significant
reduction
in
airflow
obstruction
at
formal
testing
of
bronchodilator
response
but
may
lessen
the
beneficial
effects
of
physiotherapy
in
those
without
a
positive
response
the
study
illustrates
the
importance
of
examining
difference
methods
of
chest
physiotherapy
to
find
ways
of
improving
sputum
clearance
