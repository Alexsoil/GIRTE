few
studies
of
serum
proteins
by
means
of
paper
electrophoresis
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
have
been
published
in
these
studies
alterations
of
the
serum
protein
fractions
were
found
some
of
which
were
significantly
correlated
with
the
clinical
and
radiological
severity
of
the
disease
in
the
present
study
serum
proteins
determined
by
paper
electrophoresis
in
patients
with
cf
have
been
studied
and
correlated
with
clinical
and
radiological
findings
the
serum
proteins
and
electrophoretic
patterns
if
patients
with
cf
were
followed
for
to
years
in
each
patient
for
cf
patients
as
a
whole
total
serum
protein
was
unchanged
whereas
albumin
and
albumin
globulin
ratio
were
decreased
and
all
globulin
fractions
increased
total
serum
protein
was
increased
in
patients
with
severe
pulmonary
disease
the
changes
in
total
serum
protein
and
in
all
protein
fractions
were
significantly
correlated
with
clinical
and
radiological
severity
of
the
lung
disease
all
terminal
patients
had
severe
changes
patients
with
complicating
liver
cirrhosis
had
electrophoretic
patterns
that
did
not
differ
from
those
of
other
cf
patients
it
is
concluded
that
the
main
cause
for
serum
protein
alterations
in
cf
is
the
lung
affection
whereas
liver
involvement
and
malabsorption
probably
are
of
much
less
importance
