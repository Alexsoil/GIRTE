pulmonary
clearance
for
staphylococcus
aureus
has
been
examined
in
two
inbred
strains
of
mice
with
some
hereditary
alterations
resembling
cystic
fibrosis
cf
these
mice
were
mice
with
abnormal
electrolyte

mice
without

the
methods
used
to
produce
pulmonary
infection
were
essentially
those
of
laurenzi
and
associates
adapted
as
needed
for
mutant
mice
the
animals
mentioned
above
were
exposed
to
a
finely
divided
aerosol
suspension
of
a
coagulase
positive
strain
of
s
aureus
in
phosphate
buffer
immediately
after
the
exposure
half
of
the
animals
were
killed
and
the
remaining
half
were
killed
hr
later
in
each
experimental
unit
the
mice
killed
immediately
after
the
exposure
were
as
similar
as
possible
to
the
mice
killed
hr
later
with
respect
to
genotype
age
and
sex
some
were
siblings
the
uncleared
bacteria

were

the

of
viable
staphylococci
found
immediately
after
the
aerosol
exposure
co

the

j

strain
is
significantly
lower
than
the
co
of
the
balb

dba
j

strain
p
the
latter
two
did
not
differ
from
each

there
was
no

with

data
the

cri
strain
of
mice
where
the
cri
mutation
first
appeared
has
a
decreased
capacity
for
clearance
of
s
aureus
by
the
lung
together
with
the
other
cf
like
alterations
of
the
cri
mutation
namely
failure
for
the
reabsorption
of
na
by
the
parotid
duct
high
level
of
na
in
the
fur
and
cf
abnormal
serum
factor
activity
in
the
serum
of
the
cri

mice
we
suggest
that
the
cribriform
degeneration
mouse
mutant
may
provide
a
potential
animal
model
for
studying
cf
the
finding
of
a
mouse
mutation
with
electrolyte
alterations
and
cf
like
abnormal
serum
activity
simialr
to
the
activity
found
in
cf
children
in
an
inbred
strain
of
mice
with
a
decreased
bacterial
clearance
by
the
lungs
makes
these
mice
very
useful
for
cf
studies
