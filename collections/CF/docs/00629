bronchial
washing
as
a
therapeutic
adjunct
was
performed
on
six
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
using
serial
tests
of
pulmonary
function
as
a
yardstick
for
assessment
of
efficacy
two
patients
did
not
undergo
the
procedure
and
served
as
control
subjects
all
patients
were
characterized
as
having
varying
severity
of
pulmonary
involvement
large
central
airways
were
severely
obstructed
and
older
patients
had
more
trapped
gas
in
their
lungs
hypoxemia
and
large
alveolar
arterial
oxygen
pressure
differences
p
a
a
o
were
due
to
inhomogeneity
of
alveolar
ventilation
results
indicated
that
up
to
ten
days
to
two
weeks
bronchoscopic
bronchial
washing
may
in
some
instances
improve
maximal
expiratory
flow
volume
curves
and
specific
airway
conductance
and
decrease
p

normal

alveolar

p
a
a

towards
normal
distribution
of
alveolar
gas
became
more
homogeneous
we
conclude
that
bronchoscopic
bronchial
washing
may
be
effective
in
the
management
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
by
augmentation
of
their
inadequate
cleansing
function
of
the
conducting
airways
