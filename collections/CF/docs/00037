experience
with
an
ion
specific
electrode
to
measure
sweat
chloride
the
orion
skin
chloride
measuring
system
had
been
evaluated
in
children
of
various
ages
the
method
was
found
to
give
reproducible
results
in
nearly
all
cases
failure
to
obtain
reproducibility
was
related
to
inadequate
sweating
by
the
subject
and
this
was
most
likely
to
occur
in
the
first
week
of
life
there
was
generally
a
clear
distinction
between
healthy
children
and
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
method
was
simple
and
reliable
provided
that
the
operator
had
had
reasonable
experience
with
the
instrument
one
distinct
advantage
of
the
method
compared
with
the
use
of
filter
paper
was
the
speed
with
which
results
were
obtained
the
design
of
the
instrument
made
the
method
completely
safe
and
only
a
few
patients
noticed
slight
tingling
during
iontophoresis
the
mean
sweat
chloride
in
the
normals
was
meq

compared
with

in
the
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
