works
together
with
the
previous
works
of
several
authors
reporting
low
essential
fatty
acid
concentrations
in
the
serum
lipids
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
stimulated
us
to
make
a
pilot
study
treating
older
cf
patients
with
intralipid
for
year
we
found
no
side
effects
in
treating
older
cf
patients
with
intralipid
for
year
on
the
other
hand
the
objective
benefit
was
very
limited
and
today
confusing
i
e
only
a
slight
but
significant
improvement
in
the
renal
sodium
excretion
after
an
oral
sodium
load
was
found
the
relevance
of
this
is
speculative
