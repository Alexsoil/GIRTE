role
of
antibody
in
infections
due
to
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
various
techniques
have
been
utilized
for
measurement
of
antibodies
against
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
in
general
the
results
of
such
measurements
tend
to
parallel
each
other
but
the
principal
functional
antibodies
against
pseudomonas
appear
to
be
opsonins
of
the
igg
and
igm
immunoglobulin
classes
these
antibodies
are
potentiated
by
the
complement
system
activated
either
through
the
classical
or
alternate
pathways
susceptibility
to
fatal
infection
with
pseudomonas
is
associated
with
antibody
deficiency
but
this
defect
is
usually
correlated
with
other
data
regarding
the
state
of
the
host
such
as
underlying
disease
immunosuppressive
therapy
and
functional
leukopenia
additional
information
is
needed
on
the
relative
protective
role
of
igg
and
igm
antibodies
the
affinity
of
such
antibodies
for
viable
bacteria
and
the
role
of
antibodies
against
nonlipopolysaccharide
antigens
such
as
protein
components
of
the
cell
wall
and
pseudomonas
exotoxins
