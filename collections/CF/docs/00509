kappa
chain
deficiency
an
immunoglobulin
disorder
since
kappa
chain
deficiency
is
an
unusual
condition
we
studied
the
clinical
and
laboratory
findings
in
a
patient
with
this
deficiency
the
patient
had
cystic
fibrosis
with
concurrent
malabsorption
diabetes
mellitus
and
iga
deficiency
the
serum
levels
of
igm
and
igg
were
and
mg
per
milliliter
respectively
kappa
type
igm
and
igg
was
not
present
in
serum
and
external
secretions
gamma
mu
and
lambda
chains
were
probably
polyclonal
in
character
antibodies
against
kappa
chains
were
not
detected
in
either
the
patient
or
the
mother
plasma
cells
containing
kappa
type
immunoglobulins
were
absent
in
jejunum
samples
and
bone
marrow
kappa
chainbearing
b
lymphocytes
could
not
be
detected
in
blood
and
bone
marrow
the
serum
of
one
of
the
patient
s
sisters
contained
trace
amounts
of
kappa
type
immunoglobulins
the
patient
displays
a
complete
absence
of
kappa
type
immunoglobulins
probably
owing
to
a
genetic
defect
