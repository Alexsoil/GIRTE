recent
observations
concerning
rna
methylation
and
polyamine
metabolism
in
cystic
fibrosis
pp
determination
of
fibroblast
proliferation
rates
and
rna
methylation
patterns
in
our
laboratory
has
revealed
no
alteration
in
cells
from
cystic
fibrosis
patients
blood
polyamines
are
located
predominantly
in
erythrocytes
with
low
concentrations
in
plasma
sweat
has
likewise
been
shown
to
have
a
low
content
of
spermidine
and
spermine
whole
blood
polyamine
concentrations
fluctuate
from
one
individual
to
another
and
are
especially
variable
in
females
subject
to
the
hormonal
changes
of
the
menstrual
cycle
because
of
the
variability
in
the
spermidine
and
spermine
content
of
blood
it
is
useful
to
express
such
data
on
the
basis
of
the
spermidine
spermine
ratio
however
results
must
be
analyzed
according
to
sex
and
in
the
case
of
females
should
be
interpreted
in
relationship
to
the
menstrual
cycle
spermidine
spermine
ratios
are
significantly
elevated
in
whole
blood
extracts
and
isolated
erythrocytes
from
male
cf
homo
and
heterozygotes
