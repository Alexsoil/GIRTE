fast
isoamylases
in

saliva
of

carriers
of

an
increased
number
of
fast
isoamylases
is
found
in
the
parotid
saliva
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
their
heterozygous
parents
who
are
clinically
healthy
fast
isoamylases
are
generated
at
least
in
part
from
the
isoamylases
of
the
basic
pattern
by
deamidation
of
asparagine
and
glutamine
residues
this
basic
pattern
is
present
in
the
parotid
saliva
of
all
subjects
we
have
tested
so
far
a
shift
in
the
equilibrium
between
amidation
and
deamidation
processes
is
discussed
in
terms
of
its
possible
significance
for
the
pathogenesis
of
cystic
fibrosis
and
for
ageing
