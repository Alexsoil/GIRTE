pulmonary
function
and
cardiopulmonary
complications
were
studied
in
a
group
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
who
reached
the
age
of
years
mean
values
for
vital
capacity
vc
functional
residual
capacity
residual
volume
rv
the
ratio
of
rv
over
total
lung
capacity
rv
tlc
conductance
and
the
ratio
of
the
forced
expiratory
volume
in
one
second
over
vc
were
abnormal
there
was
a
variable
pattern
of
progression
from
patient
to
patient
the
men
differed
from
the
women
only
in
that
they
had
a
significantly
larger
tlc
and
inspiratory
capacity
than
the
women
the
resultant
preservation
of
vc
may
have
an
advantage
for
survival
in
those
patients
in
whom
it
is
observed
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
was
encountered
with
increasing
frequency
with
age
massive
hemoptysis
did
not
result
in
early
death
the
occurrence
of
rightsided
heart
failure
secondary
to
cor
pulmonale
with
or
without
respiratory
failure
was
a
poor
prognostic
sign
