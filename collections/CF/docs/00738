activity
in

shown
by
a
modified

tracheal
bioassay
we
have
developed
a
modified
rabbit
tracheal
bioassay
for
use
in
investigating
a
possible
correlation
between
cystic
fibrosis
protein
cfp
and
ciliary
dyskinesia
factor
cdf
in
human
serum
the
bioassay
requires
high
standards
of
tissue
selection
and
all
epithelial
tissue
must
be
free
of
underlying
connective
tissue
when
serum
samples
were
collected
and
processed
carefully
and
warmed
to
degrees
before
assay
cdf
could
be
reliably
detected
in
of
sera
from
cystic
fibrosis
cf
homozygotes
or
obligate
heterozygotes
in
min
or
less
without
prior
fractionation
or
concentration
of
sera

and

our
results
confirm
the
association
of
cdf
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
bioassay
is
not
specific
for
cf
however
when
whole
sera
are
bioassayed
since
serum
from
several
patients
with
bronchial
asthma
also
caused
ciliary
dyskinesia
however
this
finding
need
not
preclude
using
rabbit
tracheal
ciliated
epithelial
tissue
as
an
assay
for
following
the
purification
of
cdf
isoelectric
focusing
showed
that
the
presence
or
absence
of
cfp
corresponded
with
that
of
dyskinesia
activity
in
all
sera
tested
except
for
the
active
samples
from
seven
asthma
patients
which
were
negative
for
cfp
the
results
indicate
that
cfp
and
cdf
may
be
identical
or
closely
related
markers
for
the
cf
gene
and
suggest
that
the
activity
detected
by
the
rabbit
tracheal
bioassay
in
sera
from
patients
with
asthma
and
other
diseases
probably
is
caused
by
a
substance
different
from
a
cf
specific
cdf
