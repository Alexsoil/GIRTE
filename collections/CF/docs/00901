disaccharidase
activities
in
small
intestinal
mucosa
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
disaccharidase
activities
in
small
intestinal
biopsies
were
related
to
the
morphology
of
the
mucosa
and
the
ages
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
healthy
control
subjects
of
caucasian
origin
in
patients
with
cf
and
in
the
healthy
control
subjects
under
years
of
age
with
normal
intestinal
mucosa
no
low
lactase
activity
was
found
in
those
patients
with
cf
who
were
over
years
of
age
one
group
had
high
and
one
group
had
low
lactase
activity
as
occurs
in
healthy
caucasian
control
subjects
of
the
same
age
this
finding
supports
the
view
that
in
patients
with
cf
lactase
deficiency
is
not
related
to
the
disease
entity
in
patients
with
or
without
cf
who
had
the
same
degree
of
mucosal
atrophy
the
decrease
of
disaccharidase
activities
followed
the
same
pattern
indicating
that
enzyme
activities
are
affected
to
the
same
extent
by
the
damage
of
the
mucosa
in
patients
with
cf
with
pancreatic
insufficiency
the
disaccharidase
activities
were
significantly
p
less
than
higher
when
compared
to
those
in
control
subjects
of
the
same
age
and
ethnic
group
although
the
increase
was
not
uniform
in
all
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
