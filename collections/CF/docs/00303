inhibition

by
the

of

a
study
has
been
made
of
the
effect
of
saliva
from
children
with
cystic

of

cfp
on
various
components
of
the
atp
hydrolyzing
enzyme
system
the
ouabain
sensitive
atpase
activity
of
erythrocyte
membranes
prepared
from
intact
erythrocytes
preincubated
with
cfp
saliva
was

hr
when
the

were
preincubated
with

a

in
a

ultrafiltered
saliva
was
added
directly
to
an

the
