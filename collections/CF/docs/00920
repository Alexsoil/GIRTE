does
that
child
really
have
cystic
fibrosis
a
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
was
incorrectly
made
after
false
positive
sweat
tests
in
children
of
these
children
had
been
tested
at
hospitals
where
it
seems
likely
that
sweat
tests
were
not
done
very
often
all
the
children
had
normal
sweat
electrolyte
values
when
the
test
was
repeated
at
a
regional
paediatric
centre
where
approximately
sweat
tests
are
done
each
year
in
cases
detailed
testing
of
pancreatic
function
was
normal
none
of
the
children
had
typical
chest
disease
and
only
had
gastrointestinal
symptoms
in
the
absence
of
the
typical
clinical
features
of
the
disease
a
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
should
be
made
with
extreme
caution
and
only
after
meticulous
testing
of
both
sweat
electrolytes
and
pancreatic
function
