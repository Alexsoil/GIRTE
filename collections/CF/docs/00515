the
salivary
secretions
in
health
and
disease
the
potential
usefulness
of
analysis
of
the
salivary
secretions
in
diagnosis
and
prognosis
is
beginning
to
be
explored
in
depth
the
preliminary
work
already
undertaken
indicates
that
modern
methods
applied
to
this
secretion
may
provide
information
that
is
different
from
that
obtained
in
other
body
fluids
saliva
is
collected
at
the
point
of
its
manufacture
and
therefore
is
unaffected
by
collection
or
storage
in
the
body
it
is
the
product
both
of
protein
synthesis
within
the
glands
and
of
most
of
the
known
water
and
electrolyte
exchange
mechanisms
salivary
composition
is
affected
by
both
autonomic
and
hormonal
stimuli
as
the
specific
influence
of
each
of
these
factors
is
better
understood
studies
of
this
fluid
will
provide
important
clues
to
the
understanding
of
disease
and
the
evaluation
of
therapy
there
are
few
places
in
the
body
where
it
is
possible
directly
utilizing
a
non
invasive
technique
to
examine
the
product
of
a
large
number
of
important
biological
processes
it
is
obvious
that
careful
handling
of
collection
and
analytic
techniques
are
essential
if
these
secretions
are
to
be
utilized
future
investigations
in
clinical
situations
should
take
full
advantage
of
the
strong
base
of
knowledge
of
the
physiology
of
these
glands
development
of
this
field
depends
on
careful
clinical
investigations
designed
to
make
full
use
of
our
current
knowledge
