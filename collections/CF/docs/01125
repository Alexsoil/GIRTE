nineteen
nasal
polyps
from
patients
were
examined
histologically
nine
polyps
from
seven
cystic
fibrosis
cf
patients
could
be
positively
identified
by
a
triad
of
observations
delicate
barely
visible
basement
membrane
of
surface
epithelium
without
submucosal
hyalinization
lack
of
extensive
infiltration
of
eosinophils
giemsa
stains
and
a
preponderance
of
acid
mucin
in
glands
and
cysts
of
the

in
its
surface
mucous

two
polyps
from

with

and
atopy
showed
the
characteristic
findings
of

without
modification
eight
polyps
from
four
atopic
patients
without

were
identified
by
the
reverse
triad
of
changes
extensive
thickening
of
the
epithelial
basement
membrane
and
its
extension
into
the
submucosa
as
an
