family
response
to
cystic
fibrosis
the
effects
of
cystic
fibrosis
on
victorian
families
with
one
or
more
affected
children
were
examined
in
a
study
carried
out
between
august
and
february
the
social
and
emotional
problems
experienced
by
family
members
particularly
the
patients
and
mothers
are
reported
on
at
all
ages
socially
embarrassing
symptoms
and
awareness
of
being
different
create
major
problems
for
the
patient
the
uncertainty
of
prognosis
and
doubts
about
the
prospects
of
employment
are
specially
relevant
for
the
teenager
it
is
suggested
that
the
patient
be
given
ample
opportunity
from
early
adolescence
onward
to
discuss
all
aspects
of
his
disease
and
that
more
appropriate
provision
should
be
made
for
the
total
care
of
adult
patients
many
problems
such
as
depression
feelings
of
isolation
and
the
physical
demands
of
constant
treatment
which
the
parents
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
experience
are
probably
similar
to
those
confronting
parents
of
other
chronically
ill
and
handicapped
children
but
special
difficulties
stem
from
the
genetic
basis
of
cystic
fibrosis
and
from
the
knowledge
of
an
eventually
fatal
outcome
the
roles
of
professional
members
of
the
medical
team
are
touched
on
particularly
in
relation
to
genetic
counseling
and
the
provision
of
practical
and
emotional
support
to
parents
comments
are
made
on
the
establishment
of
lay
organisations
the
financial
strain
associated
with
obtaining
regular
medical
attention
was
looked
at
and
suggestions
are
made
for
minimizing
the
economic
problems
of
certain
vulnerable
families
