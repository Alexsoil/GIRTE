pyocin
typing
of
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
over
the
last
years
pyocin
typing
has
been
a
useful
tool
for
the
epidemiological
fingerprinting
of
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
the
widely
used
scrape
and
streak
method
of
gillies
and
govan
although
simple
to
perform
has
not
been
sensitive
enough
in
differentiation
of
strains
use
of
additional
indicator
strains
might
correct
this
deficiency
the
growth
in
broth
method
of
typing
has
shown
promise
because
it
is
easily
automated
it
may
become
the
method
of
choice
when
very
sensitive
results
are
required
the
value
of
pyocin
typing
appears
to
be
well
established
in
the
study
of
nosocomial
infections
however
in
some
situations
it
may
give
misleading
results
further
studies
are
required
for
demonstration
of
the
relative
value
and
relationships
of
serological
pyocin
and
bacteriophage
typing
