the
biochemical
basis
of
cystic
fibrosis
an
hypothesis
based
upon
the
polyelectrolytes
of
mucus
the
evidence
shows
that
the
pathology
of
cystic
fibrosis
cf
is
related
to
mucoid
secretions
consequently
the
question
of
what
governs
the
viscosity
of
mucus
is
examined
in
detail
it
is
generally
agreed
that
the
mucin
gel
consists
of
polyanionic
glycoproteins
and
a
hitherto
unidentified
poly
cationic
cross
linking
protein
it
is
proposed
that
larger
amounts
of
polycations
increase
viscosity
and
in
excess
cause
mucus
to
become
a
polycation
as
these
compounds
are
known
to
inhibit
the
ductal
reabsorption
of
sodium
the
two
principal
aspects
of
the
pathology
of
cf
can
be
related
to
the
same
mechanism
the
mucus
globule
membrane
mgm
has
been
proposed
as
the
cross
linking
protein
