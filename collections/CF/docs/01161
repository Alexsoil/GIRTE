alpha
glucosidase
in
cystic
fibrosis
studies
are
presented
on
the
serum
level
of
several
acid
glycosidases
in
normal
and
cystic
fibrosis
subjects
levels
of
alpha
glucosidase
found
in
serum
from
cf
patients
were
significantly
higher
than
from
normals
and
heterozygotes
the
increase
in
alpha
glucosidase
was
directly
related
to
the
clinical
gravity
of
the
disease
levels
of
all
other
glycosidases
studied
in
cf
patients
were
in
the
normal
range
