alternative

pathway
activity
in

letter
the
possibility
has
been
raised
that
complement
plays
a
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
cystic
fibrosis
cf
this
impairment
would
be
consistent
with
the
thesis
that
the
alternative
pathway
had
been
activated
in
vivo
and
therefore
depleted
the
purpose
of
this
work
is
to
explore
further
the
function
of
the
alternative
pathway
in
cystic
fibrosis
examination
of
the
data
using
student
s
t
test
and
analysis
of
variance
showed
no
significant
difference
in
the
mean
hemolytic
activity
of
sera
of
cf
patients
as
compared
to
the
control
group
the
data
presented
do
not
support
the
work
of
polley
and
bearn
who
demonstrated
an
abnormality
in
cf
patients
using
conversion
of
c
by
inulin
as
assay
the
reason
for
this
discrepancy
is
not
clear
our
results
do
not
preclude
in
vivo
activation
of
the
alternative
pathway
since
a
compensatory
increase
in
synthesis
of
components
could
offset
component
consumption
since
the
net
result
is
a
completely
normal
level
of
activity
however
it
does
not
seem
likely
that
significant
consumption
has
occurred
