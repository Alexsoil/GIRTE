some
aspects
of
immunity
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
various
aspects
of
the
immune
status
were
examined
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
and
the
following
observations
were
made
ten
per
cent
of
the
cf
patients
had
elevated
or
reduced
serum
igg
concentrations
and
there
seems
to
be
a
transient
low
serum
iga
concentration
in
the
same
number
serum
igm
concentrations
were
normal
in
cf
patients
normal
levels
of
the
three
serum
immunoglobulins
igg
iga
and
igm
were
detected
in
the
siblings
and
heterozygotes
serum
ige
concentrations
were
elevated
in
of
patients
with
cf
but
normal
concentrations
were
detected
in
heterozygotes
and
siblings
precipitating
antibodies
to
various
antigens
and
allergens
were
detected
in
the
sputum
of
most
patients
with
cf
but
their
sera
contained
lower
or
undetectable
titres
of
these
antibodies
the
precipitating
antibodies
in
cf
sputum
to
bacteria
to
agar
to
seminal
fluid
to
urine
and
to
human
serum
may
be
related
to
a
common
antigenic
determinant
of
the
glycoproteins
present
in
all
these
fluids
the
total
protein
concentration
in
the
sputum
of
cf
patients
seemed
to
reflect
the
extent
of
lung
damage
the
third
component
c
of
serum
complement
concentration
was
normal
or
moderately
elevated
in
all
cf
patients
tested
serum
transferrin
concentrations
were
normal
in
cf
patients
but
their
prealbumin
levels
were
depressed
suggesting
marginal
undernutrition
peripheral
blood
lymphocyte
transformations
with
pha
and
pwm
appear
to
be
normal
in
cf
patients
