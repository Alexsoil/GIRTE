observations
on
gentamycin
when
used
with
other
antibiotics
in
pulmonary
infections
associated
with
cystic
fibrosis
from
to
we
hospitalized
symptomatic
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
for
intensive
pulmonary
therapy
the
more
severely
ill
patients
were
admitted
more
than
once
during
this
period
our
study
included
courses
of
such
intensive
treatment
garamycin
pediatric
injectable
containing
mg
ml
of
the
active
ingredient
was
administered
intravenously
to
all
patients
in
divided
doses
of
to
mg
kg
day
the
purpose
of
the
study
was
to
evaluate
the
tolerance
pharmacokinetics
and
efficacy
of
garamycin
when
administered
parenterally
to
cystic
fibrosis
patients
with
serious
infections
during
the
courses
of
treatment
clinical
improvement
was
rated
as
follows
significant
or
definite
improvement
moderate
improvement
slight
improvement
and
no
change
the
use
of
garamycin
pediatric
injectable
is
safe
and
can
be
helpful
in
the
management
of
the
pulmonary
infectious
complications
of
cystic
fibrosis
when
employed
along
with
other
well
established
modalities
of
therapy
