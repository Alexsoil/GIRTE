bronchial
mucus
secretion
in
cystic
fibrosis
mucus
is
the
primary
aetiological
factor
in
the
development
of
pulmonary
disease
in
cystic
fibrosis
biochemical
studies
on
bronchial
secretions
have
not
yet
confirmed
any
qualitative
difference
in
composition
or
in
the
nature
of
the
glycoproteins
the
major
component
of
secretion
with
the
lack
of
any
clear
evidence
of
a
basic
abnormality
in
the
nature
of
mucus
attention
has
been
directed
to
the
possible
defect
in
the
control
of
mucus
secretion
this
encompasses
alteration
in
the
normal
regulation
of
the
autonomic
nervous
system
or
to
its
stimulation
either
at
the
cellular
or
intracellular
control
level
in
recent
years
attention
has
focused
on
the
presence
of
ciliotoxic
factors
in
serum
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
their
possible
role
in
the
pathophysiology
of
cystic
fibrosis
control
of
mucus
secretion
submucosal
glands
goblet
cells
experimental
models
of
lung
disease
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
role
of
serum
factors
in
mucus
secretion
and
the
mucus
blanket
in
chronic
lung
disease
are
discussed
