protease
activity
in
cultivated
human
skin
fibroblasts
has
been
quantitated
using
mugb
an
active
site
titrant
of
trypsin
like
proteases
the
reaction
of
the
proteases
with
mugb
was
complete
in
hr
inhibited
both
by
benzamidine
and
p
nitrophenyl
p
guanidinobenzoate
but
not
by
p
hydroxymercuribenzoate
the
extent
of
reaction
was
proportional
to
protein
concentration
and
independent
of
mugb
concentration
this
activity
was

these

indicate
a
reduction
in

reactive
proteases
in
skin
fibroblasts
derived
from
patients
with

when
compared
either
to

these
data
are
consistent
with
our
earlier
suggestion
that
decreased
proteolytic
levels
in
the
tissues
and
fluids
of
patients
with
cf
may
be
a
generalized
phenomenon
