bronchial
hyperreactivity
in
cystic
fibrosis
and
asthma
we
studied
patients
with
cf
and
compared
their
responsiveness
to
inhaled
methacholine
to
that
of
asthmatic
children
and
normal
children
positive
responses
to
mch
occurred
in
of
the
patients
with
cf
and
of
those
with
asthma
there
was
a
significant
correlation
between
a
positive
response
to
mch
in
cf
and
poor
pulmonary
function
there
was
no
relationship
between
allergic
rhinitis
or
positive
allergen
skin
tests
and
a
positive
mch
response
dose
response
curves
and
time
course
to
mch
challenge
differed
in
cf
and
asthma
bronchial
hyperreactivity
is
thus
common
in
cf
but
is
different
from
that
in
asthma
