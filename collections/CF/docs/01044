lymphocytic
acid
hydrolases
and
response
to
mitogens
in
cystic
fibrosis
in
the
present
study
we
compared
the
levels
of
a
series
of
cultured
lymphocytic
acid
hydrolase
enzymes
in
cystic
fibrosis
homozygotes
heterozygotes
and
controls
compared
the
effects
of
three
different
mitogens
on
these
levels
and
studied
the
effect
of
cf
vs
control
serum
in
the
culture
medium
our
observations
provide
an
entirely
new
interpretation
for
the
apparent
changes
occurring
in
lymphocytic
enzymes
during
culture
of
lymphocytes
with
mitogens
and
suggest
that
a
serum
factor
is
present
in
cystic
fibrosis
serum
that
mimics
mitogens
in
this
regard
lymphocytic
acid
hydrolases
and
total
protein
are
present
in
higher
concentrations
in
lymphocytes
cultured
for
hours
without
mitogen
when
cf
homozygous
or
heterozygous
serum
is
present
in
the
culture
media
this
appears
to
result
from
a
cf
serum
factor
that
has
mitogen
like
activity
and
prevents
loss
of
cell
protein
during
culture
responsiveness
of
the
cellular
proteins
to
mitogens
is
blunted
when
cf
serum
is
present
in
the
culture
media
either
because
the
cell
proteins
are
already
maximally
stimulated
by
the
cf
serum
factor
or
the
factor
blocks
or
modifies
the
action
of
mitogens
on
lymphocyte
protein
content
this
phenomenon
is
useful
for
detection
of
cf
heterozygosity
and
appears
to
reflect
the
genetic
abnormality
causing
cystic
fibrosis
