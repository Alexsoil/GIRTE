evaluation
of
the
single
breath
diffusing
capacity
in
asthma
and
cystic
fibrosis
to
explain
why
the
single
breath
carbon
monoxide
diffusing
capacity
dsb
was
on
the
average
elevated
in
asthmatic
subjects
and
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
we
simulated
this
elevation
in
ten
normal
subjects
by
having
them
perform
the
test
for
dsb
through
an
inspiratory
obstruction
this
resulted
in
an
percent
increase
in
dsb
corrected
for
pulmonary
volume
inhalation
of
a
bronchodilator
drug
was
associated
with
relief
of
obstruction
and
a
fall
in
the
corrected
dsb
in
asthmatic
subjects
but
did
not
change
either
the
obstruction
or
the
corrected
dsb
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
we
suggest
that
elevated
dsb
in
asthma
and
cystic
fibrosis
is
partly
due
to
maximal
inspiration
against
obstructed
airways
this
requires
abnormally
negative
intrathoracic
pressures
increasing
the
pulmonary
capillary
blood
volume
and
thereby
increasing
the
dsb
