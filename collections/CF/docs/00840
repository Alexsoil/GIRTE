diploid
skin
fibroblasts
derived
from
individuals
with
the
autosomal
recessive
disease
cystic
fibrosis
cf
were
shown
previously
to
be
significantly
more
resistant
to
the
cytotoxicity
of
dexamethasone
a
glucocorticoid
hormone
than
were

here
cystic
fibrosis
fibroblasts
are
also
shown
to
be
more
resistant
than
normal
human
fibroblasts
to
the
cytotoxic
effects
of
the
sex
hormones
beta
estradiol
dihydrotestosterone
and
progesterone
since
cells
are
believed
to
contain
different
receptors
for
each
of
the
steroid
hormones
it
is
not
probable
than
the
resistance
of
cf
cells
to
these
hormones
results
from
a
receptor
deficiency
this
was
shown
by
the
fact
that
cf
cells
were
found
to
exhibit
the
same
receptor
activity
as
normal
cells
for
h
dexamethasone
furthermore
neither
normal
human
nor
cf
fibroblasts
could
be
demonstrated
to
contain
detectable
receptor
activity
for
h
beta
estradiol
in
addition
the
studies
of
fibroblast
killing
by
hormones
led
to
the
further
interesting
observation
that
normal
human
diploid
fibroblasts
regardless
of
the
sex
of
the
tissue
donor
are
sensitive
to
killing
by
each
of
the
sex
hormones
these
findings
suggest
that
the
cytotoxic
effects
of
the
steroid
hormones
may
be
observed
independently
of
the
specific
hormone
receptors
the
studies
reported
here
thus
suggest
that
the
resistance
of
cf
cells
to
the
different
steroid
hormones
is
probably
the
result
of
a
defect
in
a
pathway
in
cellular
steroid
hormone
metabolism
other
than
that
involving
receptors
