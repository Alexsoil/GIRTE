a
new
method
for
investigating
regional
lung
function
in
children
with
localized
lung
disease
lung
function
studies
using
nitrogen
have
been
used
to
determine
regional
and
total
lung
function
in
children
suspected
of
having
localized
lung
disease
amenable
to
surgery
this
method
is
simple
requires
no
active
co
operation
on
the
part
of
the
child
and
gives
a
radiation
dosage
of
about
one
third
of
that
for
a
bronchogram
the
studies
provided
information
about
the
severity
and
localization
of
the
disease
and
in
addition
information
about
the
remaining
lung
areas
