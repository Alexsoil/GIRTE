hemolytic
anemia
and
edema
as
the
initial
signs
in
infants
with
cystic
fibrosis
consider
this
diagnosis
even
in
absence
of
pulmonary
symptoms
this
is
a
report
of
five
infants
eventually
proven
to
have
cystic
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
who
presented
with
hemolytic
anemia
and
edema
since
the
sweat
test
is
often
unreliable
in
edematous
states
the
possibility
of
cystic
fibrosis
should
be
considered
use
of
either
a
protein
hydrolysate
or
addition
of
pancreatic
enzymes
will
improve
nutritional
status
and
when
edema
disappears
a
definite
sweat
test
can
be
performed
evidence
of
vitamin
e
deficiency
in
some
of
the
cases
is
presented
and
the
possibility
of
this
as
a
cause
of
anemia
is
raised
