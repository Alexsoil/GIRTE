the
coexistence
of
cystic
fibrosis
and
celiac
disease
two
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
who
subsequently
developed
celiac
disease
cd
are
described
since
organ
culture
of
intestinal
mucosa
has
been
used
to
establish
an
in
vitro
model
for
the
study
of
cd
we
utilized
this
opportunity
to
determine
whether
duodenal
mucosa
obtained
from
each
of
these
two
patients
and
their
immediate
families
differed
in
its
organ
culture
behavior
from
mucosa
obtained
from
patients
with
cd
alone
additionally
as
specific
hl
a
types
are
associated
with
cd
we
used
hl
a
typing
to
determine
whether
the
two
patients
with
cf
cd
differed
genetically
from
patients
with
cd
alone
one
of
our
patients
was
hl
a
the
most
common
type
associated
with
cd
the
other
was
hl
a
as
are
many
of
the
non
hl
a
celiac
patients
the
response
in
organ
culture
of
the
mucosa
of
these
two
patients
was
the
same
as
the
response
in
organ
culture
of
the
mucosa
from
patients
with
cd
alone
these
and
other
data
suggest
that
cd
occurring
in
patients
with
cf
is
no
different
than
cd
occurring
alone
