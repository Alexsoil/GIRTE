survival
patterns
in
cyctic
fibrosis
this
paper
describes
the
data
registry
system
of
the
cystic
fibrosis
foundation
through
this
system
an
annual
up
dated
and
corrected
data
base
has
been
prepared
for
cystic
fibrosis
patients
seen
at
u
s
a
centers
from
through
from
the
data
base
a
large
number
of
life
table
studies
are
calculated
a
study
is
specified
by
its
data
base
the
observation
period
analysis
age
age
year
or
year
since
diagnosis
the
centers
included
and
the
condition
of
patients
at
birth
and
possible
additional
factors
such
as
sex
age
at
diagnosis
or
race
the
annual
rates
of
mortality
are
measured
by
a
force
of
mortality
technique
two
techniques
have
been
used
to
appraise
the
mortality
of
particular
groups
graphing
the
cumulative
survival
function
for
the
group
together
with
the
cumulative
survival
function
for
a
comparative
group
and
calculation
of
mortality
ratios
of
actual
to
expected
deaths
by
an
applicable
standard
mortality
table
this
latter
approach
lends
itself
readily
to
tests
of
significance
for
the
purpose
of
calculating
mortality
ratios
two
standard
tables
have
been
prepared
on
the
basis
of
the
data
base
and
the
observations
the
first
of
these
standard
tables
is
for
use
with
age
year
studies
and
the
second
is
for
years
since
diagnosis
studies
the
paper
comments
on
the
number
of
mortality
studies
by
calendar
year
by
sex
by
condition
at
birth
by
age
at
diagnosis
and
of
survival
from
diagnosis
of
patients
diagnosed
in
the
calendar
year
studies
indicate
an
improvement
trend
in
the
survival
experience
from
to
but
a
change
may
be
occurring
the
study
by
sex
exhibits
a
higher
female
mortality
the
of
patients
who
have
meconium
ileus
at
birth
show
a
significantly
higher
first
year
mortality
and
a
somewhat
lower
survival
rate
thereafter
even
if
the
first
year
of
life
experience
is
excluded
mortality
data
for
groups
specified
by
age
at
diagnosis
are
given
for
patients
diagnosed
during
there
is
some
indication
of
better
survival
than
for
patients
diagnosed
prior
to
the
continuation
of
these
mortality
studies
on
an
annual
basis
should
further
our
understanding
of
survival
patterns
for
cystic
fibrosis
patients
