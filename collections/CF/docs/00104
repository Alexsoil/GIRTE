letter
frequency
of
cystic
fibrosis
gene
an
unsolved
problem
in
human
population
genetics
is
the
high
frequency
of
the
gene
for
cystic
fibrosis
c
f
in
caucasians
whereas
the
gene
frequency
is
probably
low
enough
in
non
caucasians
to
be
maintained
by
recurring
mutation
this
is
not
the
case
in
caucasians
where
the
carrier
frequency
is
approximately
in
in
order
to
establish
a
stable
genetic
polymorphism
for
a
gene
where
the
homozygous
state
is
lethal
some
degree
of
heterozygote
advantage
must
exist
and
it
has
been
suggested
that
c
f
heterozygotes
have
a
higher
reproductive
fitness
than
normal
individuals
it
is
not
possible
of
course
to
know
exactly
how
stable
the
c
f
polymorphism
is
and
one
cannot
exclude
the
possibility
that
some
form
of
heterozygote
advantage
has
existed
at
some
time
in
the
past
and
no
longer
exists
today
we
should
like
to
suggest
a
possible
explanation
which
has
much
in
common
with
the
generally
accepted
explanation
for
the
very
high
frequency
of
the
sickle
cell
gene
in
certain
populations
in
the
latter
case
heterozygotes
have
an
increased
resistance
to
a
particular
type
of
malaria
patients
with
c
f
and
heterozygous
carriers
have
been
found
to
have
in
their
serum
a
substance
probably
a
protein
that
agglutinates
proteus
vulgaris
immunological
cross
reactivity
between
certain
strains
of
proteus
e
g
ox
and
rickettsia
prowazeki
has
long
provided
the
basis
of
a
serological
test
for
typhus
weil
felix
reaction
thus
it
is
conceivable
that
the
c
f
heterozygote
might
have
an
increased
innate
ability
to
counter
infection
by
r
prowazeki
although
typhus
is
known
in
many
parts
of
the
world
it
seems
to
have
been
predominantly
endemic
and
epidemic
in
the
temperate
regions
inhabited
by
caucasian
peoples
some
areas
where
it
is
now
endemic
such
as
south
america
first
experienced
the
disease
after
it
had
been
introduced
by
europeans
this
would
seem
to
be
compatible
with
the
observed
higher
c
f
gene
frequency
in
caucasians
than
in
other
groups
