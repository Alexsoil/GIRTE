antibody

obstruction
immunoglobulin
levels
and
precipitating
antibody
against
a
range
of
microbial
antigens
were
measured
in
simultaneously
collected
serum
and
sputum
samples
from
patients
with
chronic
bronchitis
cystic
fibrosis
bronchiectasis
and
asthma
sputum
was
prepared
by
dialysis
and
high
speed
centrifugation
methods
results
showed
that
it
was
possible
to
detect
precipitating
antibody
in
the
sputum
and
the
rate
was
increased
when
both
methods
were
used
a
discrepancy
was
noted
between
the
detection
rate
in
the
sputum
and
serum
this
combined
with
the
lack
of
correlation
between
sputum
and
serum
immunoglobulins
lack
of
relationship
between
bronchial
inflammation
and
sputum
immunoglobulins
and
the
lack
of
igm
in
the
sputum
suggested
that
the
antibody
and
immunoglobulin
were
locally
produced
sputum

significantly
lower
p

significant

also
noted
in

between

in

were

the
presence
of
precipitating

in
the
sputum
raises
the
possibility
that
