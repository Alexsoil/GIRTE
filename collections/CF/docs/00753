amikacin
a
new
semisynthetic
aminoglycoside
antibiotic
with
activity
against
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
was
used
to
treat
acute
exacerbations
of
chronic
pulmonary
infections
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
patients
ranged
from
to
years
of
age
and
had
mucoid
p
aeruginosa
isolated
from
sputum
the
amikacin
dose
was
usually
mg
kg
every
eight
hours
but
was
increased
to
mg
kg
and
or
carbenicillin
was
added
in
selected
cases
depending
on
clinical
course
although
p
aeruginosa
was
not
eliminated
from
our
patients
sputum
except
in
two
cases
there
was
a
good
clinical
response
in
of
courses
significant
improvement
in
chest
x
ray
films
spirometry
or
arterial
oxygen
tension
was
documented
in
of
courses
one
instance
of
serum
creatinine
level
elevation
could
not
be
attributed
to
this
antibiotic
two
patients
showed
minimal
db
unilateral
high
frequency
hearing
loss
on
serial
audiograms
activity
against
many
gentamicin
resistant
strains
and
high
blood
levels
are
among
the
attractive
properties
of
amikacin
amikacin
is
clinically
effective
in
treating
pseudomonas
associated
pulmonary

complicating
