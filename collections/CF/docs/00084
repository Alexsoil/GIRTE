cystic
fibrosis
current
concepts
this
brief
review
emphasizes
the
paradox
of
cystic
fibrosis
a
plethora
of
abnormalities
have
been
disclosed
yet
none
can
be
accorded
the
pride
of
place
as
the
primary
inherited
abnormality
it
is
nevertheless
hoped
that
in
the
near
future
as
a
result
of
collaboration
and
integration
of
highly
specialized
areas
of
research
meaningful
and
significant
data
can
be
obtained
which
will
ultimately
be
of
value
not
only
in
identifying
heterozygotes
with
this
condition
but
also
in
the
handling
and
treatment
of
patients
with
this
common
and
disabling
inherited
disease
