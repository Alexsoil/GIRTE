studies

pp
cord
serum
amniotic
fluid
and
meconium
of
a
newborn
from
a
heterozygote
pizz
mother
were
investigated
in
the
newborn
infant
the
diagnosis
of
homozygote
pizz
deficiency
of
alpha
antitrypsin
could
be
established
in
cord
serum
at
the
time
of
delivery
trypsin
inhibitory
capacity
tic
and
alpha
antitrypsin
at
in
cord
serum
were
in
the
range
of
adult
homozygotes
by
means
of
crossed
immunoelectrophoresis
exclusively
the
phenotypic
alleles
zz
were
demonstrable
this
excludes
the
possibility
of
materno
fetal
transfer
of
alpha
antitrypsin
in
infant
amniotic
fluid
extremely
low
antiprotease
activity
and
substantially
no
alpha
antitrypsin
was
found
whereas
in
normal
samples
the
tic
is
to
of
the
cord
serum
values
and
the
at
to
of
cord
serum
concentration
our
data
suggest
that
a
major
component
of
tic
and
at
in
normal
amniotic
fluid
derive
from
the
fetus
in
normal
meconium
we
detected
tic
and
at
in
concentrations
increasing
proportionally
to
the
total
protein
content
the
inhibitory
capacity
of
at
in
meconium
expressed
in
mg
trypsin
inhibited
per
mg
alpha
antitrypsin
however
is
less
than
serum
alpha
antitrypsin
no
correlation
exists
with
the
free
tryptic
activity
of
meconium
the
at
of
an
pizz
infant
is
clearly
diminished
when
referred
to
fresh
weight
whereas
meconia
from
three
cystic
fibrosis
newborns
screened
by
the
bm
test
had
extremely
high
concentrations
estimation
of
tic
and
at
in
meconium
is
regarded
as
a
useful
approach
for
screening
on
homozygote
alpha
antitrypsin
deficiency
the
exact
diagnosis
however
can
only
be
established
by
phenotyping
the
alleles
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
high
protein
content
of
meconium
is
accompanied
by
increased
alpha
antitrypsin
levels
