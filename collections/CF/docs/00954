detection
of
cystic
fibrosis
protein
by
electrofocusing
letter
wilson
et
al
reported
a
biophysical
assay
for
cystic
fibrosis
that
employed
isoelectric
focusing
of
serum
proteins
their
work
appeared
to
establish
the
presence
of
a
definitive
marker
for
cf
serum
in
the
form
of
a
protein
band
that
was
not
present
in
normal
serum
we
tried
to
repeat
their
work
and
found
that
the
background
color
of
the
fresh
electropherograms
made
it
rather
difficult
to
detect
unequivocally
the
presence
or
absence
of
bands
in
the
appropriate
ph
region
in
cf
vs
control
serum
however
when
the
gels
were
photographed
using
kodak
panatomic
x
film
and
a
wratten
a
red
filter
the
color
response
and
contrast
of
the
film
eliminated
this
interference
to
a
great
extent
and
it
was
much
easier
to
detect
the
putative
band
we
agree
partially
with
the
observations
of
wilson
and
fudenberg
but
would
like
to
stress
that
the
technique
is
not
a
diagnostic
test
