sweat
tests
in
cystic
fibrosis
letter
dr
smalley
and
her
colleagues
rightly
stress
that
the
commonest
reason
for
abnormally
high
sweat
electrolyte
levels
apart
from
cystic
fibrosis
is
faulty
technique
a
further
cause
of
false
positive
results
and
potentially
more
important
than
the
list
of
rare
disorders
usually
cited
is
atopic
dermatitis
dr
m
ampola
and
i
investigated
ten
children
with
eczema
at
the
tufts
new
england
medical
center
boston
and
found
higher
sodium
and
or
chloride
levels
in
sweat
obtained
from
affected
skin
than
in
sweat
from
normal
skin
in
the
same
individuals
in
four
of
these
atopic
children
levels
within
the
diagnostic
range
for
cystic
fibrosis
were
obtained
above
mmol
l
