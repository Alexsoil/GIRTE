in

the
prominent
role
of
infection
in
the
clinical
course
of
cystic
fibrosis
has
led
to
considerable
investigation
of
possible
immune
deficiency
in
these
patients
leukotaxis

the

against

these
properties
were
investigated
in
patients
with
clinically
stable
cystic
fibrosis
to
determine
if
they
possess
dysfunctional
inflammatory
responses
which
would
predispose
them
to
