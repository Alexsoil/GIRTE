the

for
the
sodium

inhibitory

in

was
modified
by
using
the

parotid
gland
of
the
rat
as
a
control
carefully
controlling
the
quantity
of
saliva
perfused
into
the
rat
parotid
gland
so
that
the
ratio
of
milliliters
perfused
to
gram
dry

weight
fell
between

calculated
from
the
difference

using
this

assay
we
were
able
to
confirm
that
