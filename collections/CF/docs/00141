arginine

activity
in
chloroform
ellagic
acid
treated
plasma
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
and
age
matched
control
subjects
has
been
resolved
into
its
component
fractions
by
ion
exchange
chromatography
on
deae
sephadex
and
electrofocusing
on
polyacrylamide
gels
the
activity
can
be
resolved
into
two
fractions
by
chromatography
one
of
which
is
inhibited
by
soybean
trypsin
inhibitor
sti
and
the
other
of
which
is
not
inhibited
by
sti
in
plasma
of
cf
patients
the
fraction
of
activity
inhibited
by
sti
is
reduced
to
approximately
of
the
corresponding
fraction
in
control
plasma
in
contrast
the
fraction
of
activity
resistant
to
inhibition
by
sti
did
not
show
any
significant
quantitative
differences
between
control
and
cf
plasma
samples
analysis
of
plasma
samples
by
electrofocusing
on
polyacrylamide
gels
in
the
range
of
ph
and
subsequent
staining
for
arginine
esterase
activity
showed
qualitative
differences
between
control
and
cf
plasma
samples
six
activity
bands
could
be
detected
in
control
samples
whereas
five
bands
were
detected
in
cf
samples
eight
samples
had
one
type
of
band
missing
two
had
another
type
of
band
missing
and
one
had
yet
another
type
of
band
missing
all
of
these
bands
were
restricted
to
a
narrow
ph
zone
in
the
center
of
the
gel
these
data
are
consistent
with
and
extend
our
earlier
reports
of
differences
in
arginine
esterase
activity
between
plasma
samples
of
cf
patients
and
control
subjects
the
demonstration
of
the
absence
of
a
single
band
of
arginine
esterase
activity
is
consistent
with
the
absence
of
a
specific
arginine
esterase
isoenzyme
in
patients
with
cf
the
deficiency
of
arginine
esterase
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
may
account
for
the
presence
of
factors
in
saliva
plasma
and
fibroblasts
of
these
patients
and
consequently
for
the
clinical
manifestations
of
the
disease
