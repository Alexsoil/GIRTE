enhanced
renal
excretion
of
dicloxacillin
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
single
oral
doses
of
mg
kg
of
dicloxacillin
suspension
were
given
to
ten
cystic
fibrosis
cf
patients
and
eight
normal
subjects
peak
serum
concentrations
and
areas
under
the
concentration
versus
time
curves
for
dicloxacillin
were
variable
and
on
average
were
times
lower
in
the
cf
patients
the
time
of
occurrence
of
the
peak
serum
concentration
was
similar
in
both
groups
and
the
total
urinary
recovery
of
dicloxacillin
was
normal
or
increased
in
the
cf
patients
suggesting
that
the
intestinal
absorption
of
the
drug
was
unaffected
by
the
disease
the
low
serum
concentrations
in
the
cf
patients
were
caused
by
unusually
high
renal
clearances
of
dicloxacillin
which
average
compared
to
ml
min
sq
m
in
the
normal
subjects
creatinine
clearances
were
also
elevated
in
the
cf
patients
by
on
average
while
urea
clearances
were
normal
the
serum
protein
binding
of
dicloxacillin
was
similar
in
both
groups
of
subjects
because
the
rapid
excretion
results
in
low
and
variable
serum
concentrations
of
the
antibiotic
treatment
of
cf
patients
with
dicloxacillin
may
warrant
use
of
increased
or
more
frequent
doses
and
monitoring
of
serum
antibiotic
levels
