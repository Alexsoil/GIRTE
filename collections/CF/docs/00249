demonstration
of
a
factor
in
the
serum
of
homozygotes
and
heterozygotes
for
cystic
fibrosis
by
a
non
biological
technique
a
factor
has
been
isolated
from
serum
of
homozygotes
and
obligate
heterozygotes
for
cystic
fibrosis
using
isoelectric
focusing
and
disc
electrophoresis
as
analytical
methods
the
factor
is
focused
within
an
igg
fraction
with
an
isoelectric
point
of
ph
to
but
differs
from
igg
in
its
lower
molecular
weight
it
is
thus
similar
to
if
not
identical
with
the
ciliary
dyskinesia
factor
