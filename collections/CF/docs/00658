letter
roller
and
kern
report
that
bile
acid
malabsorption
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
and
acquired
pancreatic
insufficiency
is
minimal
these
findings
are
at
variance
with
other
studies
and
deserve
comment
in
the
absence
of
fecal
bile
acid
values
in
controls
the
authors
cannot
state
that
levels
in
cf
are
only
twice
normal
values
especially
since
the
papers
cited
on
normal
bile
acid
excretion
refer
to
measurements
obtained
by
a
different
technique
we
also
question
the
validity
of
the
breath
test
as
an
index
of
bile
acid
malabsorption
in
cf
our
recent
report
shows
that
in
older
cf
mean
age
years
the
magnitude
of
bile
acid
loss
in
the
stools
was
comparable
to
that
of
the
younger
age
group
mean
age
years
and
that
there
was
no
correlation
between
the
age
and
the
degree
of
bile
acid
loss
on
the
other
hand
we
must
take
issue
with
roller
and
kern
when
they
suggest
that
bile
acid
malabsorption
in
cf
is
probably
not
clinically
important
our
findings
not
only
bear
relevance
to
the
intestinal
manifestations
of
cf
and
to
the
increased
incidence
of
cholelithiasis
but
perhaps
also
to
the
early
deposition
within
the
intrahepatic
ducts
of
eosinophilic
mucus
concretions
proposed
as
the
cause
of
biliary
cirrhosis
in
this
disease
