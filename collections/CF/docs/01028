enzyme
immunoassay
of
albumin
as
an
aid
to
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
the
newborn
human
proceedings
one
of
the
symptoms
of
cystic
fibrosis
mucoviscidosis
is
pancreatic
insufficiency
the
reduced
proteolytic
activity
in
the
gut
of
children
with
the
disease
results
in
an
elevated
concentration
of
protein
especially
serum
albumin
in
the
meconium
this
feature
is
used
in
the
diagnosis
of
the
disease
in
the
newborn
and
we
decided
to
examine
the
utility
of
enzyme
immunoassay
for
the
measurement
of
albumin
in
meconium
samples
from
normal
and
cystic
fibrosis
infants
normal
samples
were
found
to
have
apparent
albumin
concentrations
in
the
range
mg
g
dry
wt
whereas
cystic
fibrosis
samples
had
concentrations
in
the
range
mg
g
dry
wt
the
assay
provides
a
cheap
and
relatively
rapid
method
of
differentiating
cystic
fibrosis
positive
and
negative
meconium
samples
