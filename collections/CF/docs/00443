gastrointestinal
and
nutritional
manifestations
of
cystic
fibrosis
pp
the
purpose
of
this
paper
is
to
summarize
the
present
state
of
our
knowledge
of
the
gastrointestinal
manifestations
and
absorption
and
metabolism
of
nutrients
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
gastrointestinal
manifestations
include
pancreatic
exocrine
insufficiency
pancreatic
calcification
and
stones
diabetes
liver
and
gall
bladder
abnormalities
intestinal
obstruction
and
complications
of
malabsorption
nutritional
aspects
of
cystic
fibrosis
include
growth
retardation
and
body
composition
fat
and
nitrogen
absorption
amino
acid
absorption
medium
chain
triglyceride
absorption
and
deficiency
of
fat
soluble
vitamins
the
critical
questions
for
projection
into
the
future
fall
into
three
categories
intestinal
absorption
gastrointestinal
function
and
experimental
design
