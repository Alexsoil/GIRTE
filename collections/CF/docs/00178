the
occurrence
of
antibodies
against
antigens
prepared
from
strains
representing
o
groups
of
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
and
against
a
polyvalent
ps
aeruginosa
antigen
st
ag
has
been
investigated
in
sera
from
patients
by
means
of
fused
rocket
immunoelectrophoresis
with
intermediate
gel
it
was
found
that
the
humoral
immune
response
against
ps
aeruginosa
resulting
in
precipitating
antibodies
will
be
detected
by
st
ag
as
well
as
by
any
other
of
the
antigen
samples
investigated
six
of
the
sera
contained
group
specific
antibodies
which
were
revealed
by
only
one
of
the
antigen
samples
used
and
not
by
st
ag
these
six
sera
were
further
studied
by
means
of
various
quantitative
immunoelectrophoretic
methods
using
st
ag
as
well
as
antigens
prepared
from
the
infecting
ps
aeruginosa
strain
in
the
patient
concerned
in
all
six
sera
only
one
extra
precipitin
could
be
detected
using
antigens
prepared
from
the
homologous
strain
instead
of
st
ag
this
extra
precipitin
corresponded
presumably
to
group
specific
o
antigens
not
included
in
st
ag
in
sera
from
patients
these
group
specific
antibodies
were
always
accompanied
by
antibodies
against
antigens
common
to
all
strains
of
ps
aeruginosa
