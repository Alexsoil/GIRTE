the
in
vitro
electrical
properties
of
rat
jejunum
were
utilized
to
assay
a
factor
or
factors
in
serum
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
sera
from
patients
with
cf
were
found
to
decrease
short
circuit
current
scc
and
the
scc
response
to
glucose
and
to
increase
electrical
resistance
these
effects
were
present
in
all
patients
with
cf
and
of
parents
of
cf
patients
and
absent
from
the
serum
of
control
subjects
this
quantitative
technique
provides
an
alternative
to
the
ciliostatic
assays
for
the
detection
of
the
cf
factor
or
factors
