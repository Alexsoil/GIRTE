comparative
trial
of
manual
and
mechanical
percussion
technique
with
gravity
assisted
bronchial
drainage
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
chest
physiotherapy
still
remains
one
of
the
most
important
aspects
in
the
treatment
of
chest
complications
of
cystic
fibrosis
a
mechanical
device
that
allows
the
patient
with
cystic
fibrosis
to
do
his
own
chest
physiotherapy
will
be
of
great
benefit
if
it
is
as
effective
as
manual
percussion
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
using
mechanical
and
manual
percussion
physiotherapy
were
studied
by
measuring
sputum
volumes
and
fev
and
fvc
results
with
mechanical
percussor
were
as
good
as
with
the
manual
percussor
and
therefore
it
would
be
reasonable
for
the
older
patient
to
use
the
former
on
his
own
