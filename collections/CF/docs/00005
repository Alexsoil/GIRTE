proteolytic

in
duodenal
juice
in
infants
children
and
adults
the
capacity
of
duodenal
juice
to
hydrolyse
casein
to
trichloroacetic
acid
soluble
peptides
was
investigated
in
a
control
group
infants
and
children
and
adults
in
children
with
pancreatic
disease
in
children
with
enterogenic
malabsorption
coeliac
disease
and
cow
s
milk
protein
intolerance
the
proteolytic
activity
per
ml
duodenal
juice
in
fasting
condition
was
as
great
in
healthy
infants
and
children
as
healthy
adults
mg
casein
ml
hour
there
was
a
good
correlation
between
trypsin
content
and
proteolytic
activity
of
duodenal
juice
in
pancreatic
insufficiency
the
proteolytic
activity
was
extremely
low
not
measurable
in
patients
as
was
the
trypsin
activity
whereas
in
enterogenic
malabsorption
it
was
within
the
ranges
of
the
controls
