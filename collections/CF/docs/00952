cystic
fibrosis
the
prognosis
for
five
year
survival
statistical
discriminant
analysis
is
applied
to
concomitant
variables
obtained
during
the
first
year
of
study
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
a
discriminant
function
based
on
six
variables
is
developed
which
can
be
used
as
a
predictive
index
this
index
estimates
the
probability
of
year
survival
for
an
individual
patient
and
can
also
be
used
to
classify
patients
into
one
of
two
groups
will
live
for
years
or
will
die
within
years
speculation
a
classification
rule
for
cystic
fibrosis
is
presented
which
correctly
assigns
of
the
year
survivors
and
of
those
who
expire
such
a
classification
scheme
is
useful
for
clinical
and
research
purposes
