aspects
of
bile
acid
metabolism
in
cystic
fibrosis
previous
reports
have
indicated
that
cystic
fibrosis
cf
patients
with
pancreatic
enzyme
insufficiency
have
a
raised
faecal
bile
acid
output
in
this
study
out
of
cf
patients
and
out
of
the
non
cf
patients
with
pancreatic
enzyme
insufficiency
had
raised
faecal
bile
acid
levels
in
the
cf
patients
no
correlation
was
found
between
faecal
bile
acid
and
faecal
fat
excretion
but
an
inverse
relation
was
shown
between
faecal
bile
acid
values
and
age
those
cf
patients
with
overt
liver
disease
tended
to
have
the
lowest
faecal
bile
acid
values
duodenal
spiration
in
cf
patients
and
in
one
non
cf
patient
with
pancreatic
enzyme
insufficiency
shwachman
diamond
syndrome
produced
very
small
fluid
volumes
duodenal
fluid
mean
total
bile
acid
concentrations
were
within
normal
limits
estimation
of
serum
bile
acids
in
these
patients
showed
that
patients
had
raised
serum
bile
acid
values
it
is
suggested
that
excessive
faecal
bile
acid
loss
may
produce
a
contraction
of
the
bile
acid
pool
and
lead
eventually
to
a
reduction
of
intraduodenal
bile
acid
concentrations
measures
which
curtail
faecal
bile
acid
loss
may
have
a
particular
significance
in
the
management
of
