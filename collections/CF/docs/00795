for

in
sweat
a
modified
method
of
analysis
of
sweat
chloride
concentration
with
an
ion
selective
electrode
is
presented
the
original
method
of
sweat
chloride
analysis
proposed
by
the
orion
research
corporation
cambridge
massachusetts
is
inadequate
because
it
produces
erratic
and
misleading
results
the
modified
method
was
compared
with
the
reference
quantitative
method
of
gibson
and
cooke
in
the
modified
method
individual
electrode
pads
are
cut
and
placed
in
the
electrodes
rather
than
using
the
pads
supplied
by
the
company
pilocarpine
nitrate
mg
l
is
used
in
place
of
pilocarpine
hcl
mg
l
sodium
bicarbonate
as
the
weak
electrolyte
is
used
instead
of
k
so
a
minute
period
for
sweat
accumulation
is
employed
rather
than
a
zero
time
collection
as
in
the
original
orion
method
the
modification
has
been
studied
for
reproducibility
in
individuals
reproducibility
between
right
and
left
arm
in
individuals
it
has
been
compared
extensively
with
the
quantitative
method
of
gibson
and
cooke
both
in
normal
individuals
and
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
there
is
excellent
agreement
between
the
modified
method
and
the
quantitative
reference
method
there
appears
to
be
a
slight
bias
toward
higher
concentrations
of
chloride
from
the
right
arm
compared
with
the
left
arm
but
this
difference
is
not
medically
significant
