increased
dexamethasone
resistance
of
cystic
fibrosis
fibroblasts
we
demonstrate
previously
that
fibroblasts
from
cystic
fibrosis
cf
patients
are
significantly
more
resistant
to
the
toxic
effects
of
ouabain
than
normal
human
fibroblasts
are
ouabain
is
generally
assumed
to
act
primarily
at
the
level
of
the
cell
membrane
and
to
cause
killing
of
cells
by
inhibiting
ion
transport
we
have
therefore
examined
the
ability
of
normal
and
cf
cells
to
survive
exposure
to
ethacrynic
acid
another
inhibitor
of
ion
transport
and
to
survive
colchicine
and
aminopterin
resistance
to
which
has
been
associated
with
membrane
alterations
in
other
cells
the
effect
of
dexamethasone
which
has
a
sterol
nucleus
similar
to
that
of
ouabain
but
is
thought
to
have
a
different
site
of
cellular
action
was
also
tested
exposure
of
the
cells
to
ethacrynic
acid
colchicine
or
aminopterin
did
not
reveal
any
differences
in
survival
between
normal
and
cf
fibroblasts
however
cf
cells
survived
exposure
to
dexamethasone
significantly
better
than
normal
cells
did
these
results
suggest
that
normal
and
cf
cells
do
not
differ
in
terms
of
a
generalized
resistance
to
ion
transport
inhibitors
or
to
drugs
that
must
pass
through
the
membrane
to
be
active
instead
the
results
raise
the
possibility
that
cf
cells
have
an
enhanced
resistance
to
drugs
that
have
the
sterol
nucleus
found
in
ouabain
and
dexamethasone
