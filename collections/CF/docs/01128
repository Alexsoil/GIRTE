letter
we
have
measured
immunoreactive
trypsin
irt
activity
in
dried
blood
spot
samples
and
have
found
abnormally
high
levels
in
infants
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
we
agree
with
crossley
et
al
that
this
test
deserves
further
investigation
as
a
screen
for
cf
in
the
newborn
the
low
value
for
the
week
infant
is
consistent
with
their
finding
that
in
children
with
low
pancreatic
enzyme
output
the
increased
irt
results
are
restricted
to
the
first
few
months
of
life
it
remains
to
be
proved
whether
older
cf
patients
with
residual
pancreatic
enzyme
secretion
do
indeed
continue
to
have
increased
irt
levels
if
they
do
the
irt
test
would
also
deserve
further
investigation
as
a
tool
to
be
used
in

stool
