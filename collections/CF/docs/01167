the

plasma
on

gastric
mucosa
an
alternative
method
for
assaying
the
cystic
fibrosis
factor
could
be
on
the
electrophysiological
responses
of
isolated
living
tissues
the
ability
of
the
frog
s
gastric
mucosa
to
secrete
hydrochloric
acid
and
maintain
a
negative
potential
difference
is
well
known
this
potential
difference
across
the
secretory
mucosa
to
the
nutrient
serosa
side
coupled
with
its
property
of
transporting
chloride
and
hydrogen
ions
against
an
electrochemical
gradient
could
therefore
serve
as
a
useful
model
for
investigating
any
induced
changes
in
the

of
cf
and
non
cf
plasma
from
the

obtained
the
short

current
and
h
secretion
responses
in
the
presence
of

whole
plasma
show
significant
increases
compared
to
the

these
findings
show
that
in
the
presence
of

plasma
whole

fraction
b
there
is
a
marked
increase
in
the
actively

the
effect
of

plasma
in

is
important
considering
the
elevation
of
this

in
