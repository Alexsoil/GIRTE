echocardiographic
abnormalities
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
an
echographic
study
was
undertaken
to
evaluate
left
lv
and
right
ventricular
rv
function
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
echographic
recording
of
the
pulmonary
and
aortic
valve
echogram
permitted
measurement
of
the
phases
of
right

left
ventricular
systole
the

of
the
lv
preejection
period
lv
ejection
time
lpep

shortening

was
employed
to
reflect
lv
function
while
rv

rpep

and
two
other
echographic
measurements
right

were
compared
with
