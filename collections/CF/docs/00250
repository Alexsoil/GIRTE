involvement
of
the
ear
nose
and
paranasal
sinuses
twenty
six
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
all
exhibited
disease
of
the
paranasal
sinuses
consisting
of
opacification
of
the
maxillary
sinuses
either
alone
or
as
part
of
a
parasinusitis
symptoms
of
sinusitis
seldom
occurred
and
treatment
was
not
generally
required
agenesis
or
delayed
development
of
frontal
sinuses
was
also
seen
in
the
majority
of
patients
nasal
polyps
occurred
in
of
the
patients
all
of
whom
were
over
five
years
of
age
excluding
those
patients
under
five
years
of
age
none
of
whom
had
polyps
the
incidence
was
in
general
polyps
were
not
observed
in
those
patients
with
severe
disease
mild
degrees
of
conductive
hearing
loss
were
noted
in
the
younger
age
groups
especially
but
no
instance
of
severe
hearing
loss
or
nerve
conduction
disturbance
was
encountered
such
mild
degrees
of
hearing
loss
may
merely
reflect
the
application
of
standards
too
stringent
for
this
age
group
throat

nose
cultures
on
patients
revealed
pseudomonas

in
eighteen
cases
reflecting
the
flora
of
the
tracheobronchial

other

were
encountered
on
an

basis
with
findings
