differences
in
the
incorporation
of
thymidine
into
dna
of
normal
and
cystic
fibrosis
fibroblasts
in
vitro
although
similar
fractions
of
cells
were
in
the
s
phase
of
the
cell
cycle
normal
human
skin
fibroblasts
were
shown
to
incorporate
more
than
twice
the
htdr
into
their
dna
in
vitro
than
did
cells
obtained
from
individuals
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
obligate
heterozygotes
incorporated
an
intermediate
amount
of
the
dna
precursor
studied
were
initiated
to
determine
the
basis
of
the
differential
incorporation
of
htdr
among
the
genotypes
an
analog
of
thymidine
budr
produced
varied
effects
on
the
growth
kinetics
of
the
three
genotypes
the
growth
of
cells
in
budr
resulted
in
a
increase
in
the
population
doubling
times
of
all
three
genotypes
and
caused
the
cell
morphology
to
change
from
a
spindle
shape
to
one
in
which
the
cells
became
broadened
and
flat
with
numerous
cytoplasmic
projections
extending
for
distances
of
several
cell
diameters
the
activities
of
thymidine
kinase
and
the
participation
of
the
exogenous
and
de
novo
pathways
in
the
synthesis
of
tmp
were
found
to
be
approximately
the
same
in
all
three
genotypes
the
data
suggest
that
an
alteration
in
the
transport
of
thymidine
into
the
cells
may
account
for
the
differences
in
tdr
incorporation
into
dna
and
this
may
be
associated
with
other
changes
in
cystic
fibrosis
that
are
apparently
membrane
associated
