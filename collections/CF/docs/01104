technique
and
long
term
results
severe
bronchial
hemorrhage
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
was
treated
by
catheter
embolization
of
bronchial
arteries
indications
were
either
excessive
bleeding
persisting
for
several
days
or
bleeding
serious
enough
to
interfere
with
pulmonary
drainage
and
recurring
over
weeks
or
months
in
follow
up
ranging
from
one
to
months
cessation
of
major
bleeding
was
achieved
in
of
patients
although
of
patients
did
have
recurrence
of
minor
hemoptysis
no
neurologic
or
other
major
complications
were
encountered
however
there
are
potential
risks
and
this
approach
at
present
should
be
limited
to
patients
with
life
threatening
bleeding
and
carried
out
only
by
experienced
angiographers
