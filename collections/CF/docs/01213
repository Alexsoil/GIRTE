intravenous

acid
supplementation
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
ten
children
with
cf
in
matched
pairs
were
infused
with
either
intralipid
or
with
glucose
on
a
double
blind
basis
every
other
week
for
one
year
although
statistically
there
was
significantly
greater
gain
in
height
and
weight
in
the
study
year
compared
to
the
previous

only
for
the

group
both
groups
improved

cumulative

for
the
intralipid
group
of
a

p
less
than
this
study
indicates
the
need
to
better
define
the
role
of
nutrition
in
the
pathophysiology
of
cf
meanwhile
it
is
recommended
that
all
children
with
cf
have
plasma
linoleic
acid
levels
measured
at

once
yearly
and
if
levels
are
low
appropriate
supplements
should
be
given
