polypoid
cervicitis
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
receiving
oral
contraceptives
three
of
the
women
in
a
cystic
fibrosis
clinic
who
used
a
combined
form
of
oral
contraceptive
developed
acute
polypoid
cervicitis
in
one
woman
the
polyp
recurred
on
reinstitution
of
the
medication
there
was
resolution
of
the
polyp
in
each
instance
on
discontinuation
of
the
drugs
in
of
the
affected
women
there
was
coincidental
deterioration
of
respiratory
status
therefore
it
is
suggested
that
cystic
fibrosis
patients
who
are
using
oral
contraception
be
observed
closely
regarding
pulmonary
and
gynecologic
status
