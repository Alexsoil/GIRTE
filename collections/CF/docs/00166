histochemical
observations
on
the
pulmonary
macrophages
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
pulmonary
macrophages
collected
with
bronchial
mucus
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
other
chronic
lung
diseases
were
investigated
histochemically
for
acid
phosphatase
beta
glucuronidase
and
beta
glucosaminidase
activity
and
also
for
mucopolysaccharide
content
in
macrophages
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
decreased
beta
glucuronidase
activity
was
observed
together
with
large
cytoplasmic
vacuoles
suggesting
storage
of
partially
digested
material
it
thus
seems
very
likely
that
apart
from
the
increased
synthesis
of
mucopolysaccharides
described
in
cystic
fibrosis
by
several
authors
the
degradation
of
mucosubstances
produced
can
be
impaired
