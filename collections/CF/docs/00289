cystic
fibrosis
detection
of
heterozygotes
samuels
and
elliott
have
described
a
new
technique
for
detecting
cystic
fibrosis
c
f
and
the
heterozygote
for
c
f
we
have
tested
this
technique
in
detail
on
a
smaller
number
of
patients
although
the
number
of
samples
tested
in
our
study
is
small
results
suggest
that
this
technique
is
not
likely
to
be
successful
in
detection
of
heterozygotes
for
c
f
