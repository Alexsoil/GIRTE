the
effects
of
acute
diuresis
in
patients
with
cor
pulmonale
secondary
to
cystic
fibrosis
were
studied
both
hemodynamic
parameters
and
arterial
blood
gas
changes
were
investigated
the
major
effect
noted
was
a
significant
reduction
of
systemic
venous
pressure
pulmonary
artery
and
pulmonary
artery
wedge
pressure
either
remained
constant
or
declined
slightly
no
consistent
changes
were
noted
in
cardiac
output
or
arterial
blood
gases
acute
diuresis
of
moderate
degree
appears
to
be
a
safe
and
effective
manner
in
which
to
treat
the
systemic
