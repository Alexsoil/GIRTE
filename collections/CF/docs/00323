evaluation
of
bronchial
drainage
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
examined
in
this
study
are
the
results
of
six
tests
of
pulmonary
function
immediately
preceding
and
following
bronchial
drainage
in
twenty
six
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
highly
significant
increases
averaging
and
percent
occurred
in
peak
expiratory
flow
rate
forced
vital
capacity
expiratory
reserve
volume
and
inspiratory
capacity
respectively
significant
increases
in
peak
expiratory
flow
rate
forced
vital
capacity
and
inspiratory
capacity
were
observed
in
a
subgroup
of
six
of
the
above
patients
who
had
evidence
of
bronchospasm
the
authors
conclude
that
bronchial
drainage
will
produce
significant
increases
in
routine
pulmonary
function
values
the
results
suggest
that
this
treatment
is
most
effective
in
clearing
the
larger
more
proximal
airways
and
is
of
benefit
even
in
the
presence
of
clinical
bronchospasm
