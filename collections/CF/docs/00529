simple
technique
for
detection
of
cystic
fibrosis
heterozygotes
and
homozygotes
we
examined
serum
proteins
from
cf
subjects
and
control
individuals
we
were
unable
to
detect
any
consistent
differences
between
the
stained
serum
protein
patterns
of
the
cf
and
the
control
subjects
these
patterns
show
greater
resolution
of
proteins
than
those
previously
published
but
in
contrast
no
consistent
differences
between
cf
and
control
subjects
in
addition
we
have
modified
the
published
methods
with
procedures
which
would
enhance
the
likelihood
of
electrophoretic
detection
of
an
abnormal
protein
with
the
reported
properties
a
portion
of
the
samples
analyzed
by
the
published
procedures
also
were
analyzed
by
each
of
these
modifications
none
of
the
modified
procedures
showed
consistent
differences
between
serum
proteins
from
the
cf
and
the
control
subjects
no
explanation
is
readily
apparent
for
the
difference
between
results
of
thomas
et
al
and
our
own
results
on
the
one
hand
and
the
previously
reported
results
on
the
other
we
attempted
to
rigorously
reproduce
the
isoelectric
focusing
techniques
given
in
the
literature
however
isoelectric
focusing
in
polyacrylamide
gel
can
be
affected
by
small
technical
differences
and
thus
factors
essential
to
reproducing
the
techniques
may
not
have
been
evident
in
the
published
procedure
