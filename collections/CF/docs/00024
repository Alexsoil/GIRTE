lung
elastic

in
cystic
fibrosis
the
pressure
volume
behavior
of
the
lung
was
studied
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
isovolume
flow
pressure
relationships
were
measured
in
of
these
patients
and
a
modification
of
the
flow
volume
test
was
evaluated
for
detection
of
flow
reduction
in
a
separate
group
of
patients
relative
to
results
in
a
control
group
of
normal
subjects
of
the
patients
had
grossly
abnormal
pressure
volume
curves
with
excessive
stiffness
of
the
lung
near
maximum
volume
and
loss
of
recoil
at
lower
volume
closing
volumes
in
these
patients
were
often
high
enough
to
cause
significant
disturbances
in
gas
exchange
and
the
elevated
closing
volumes
were
quantitatively
explained
by
the
low
values
for
elastic
recoil
the
modified
flow
volume
test
detected
mild
flow
reduction
in
many
patients
who
otherwise
had
normal
pulmonary
function
tests
loss
of
recoil
per
se
did
not
account
for
the
low
maximum
expiratory
flows
since
upstream
resistances
were
high
however
pressure
flow
curves
were
effort
dependent
at
high
lung
volumes
even
in
patients
with
severe
airway
obstruction
showing
that
time
constants
of
emptying
varied
widely
in
these
patients
it
was
concluded
that
deterioration
of
lung
function
in
cystic
fibrosis
involves
more
than
airway
obstruction
and
that
the
worsening
gas
trapping
is
explained
by
a
progressive
loss
of
lung
elastic
recoil
