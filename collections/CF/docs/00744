improved
method
for
detection
of
cystic
fibrosis
protein
in
serum
using
the
lkb
multiphor
electrofocusing
apparatus
we
have
developed
an
improved
method
for
the
detection
of
cystic
fibrosis
protein
cfp
the
method
employs
the
lkb
multiphor
to
electrofocus
whole
serum
instead
of
the
apparatus
used
in
previous
studies
two
basic
modifications
were
necessary
a
ph
gradient
instead
of
a
ph
gradient
and
constant
power
for
focusing
the
serum
proteins
instead
of
constant
voltage
the
first
modification
ensured
adequate
dissolution
of
the
cfp
igg
complexes
or
other
precursor
complexes
which
may
liberate
cfp
the
second
modification
ensured
a
linear
gradient
between
ph
and
ph
excellent
resolution
in
the
ph
region
and
the
separation
of
cfp
within
hr
without
overheating
of
the
gel
electrofocusing
with
the
lkb
multiphor
permits
the
detection
of
cfp
in
as
many
as
serum
samples
per
gel
results
obtained
from
the
analysis
of
cystic
fibrosis
obligate
heterozygote
carrier
and
normal
control
sera
indicate
that
cfp
can
be
reproducibly
and
accurately
detected
in
sera
using
the
lkb
multiphor
