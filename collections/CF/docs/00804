treatment
and
prognosis
of
massive
hemoptysis
in
cystic
fibrosis
massive
hemoptysis
volume
of
expectorated
blood
ml
in
hours
occurred
in
per
cent
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
twenty
two
of
the
patients
were
in
the
midst
of
a
relatively
long
lasting
flare
up
of
pulmonary
infection
there
was
no
other
consistent
precipitating
event
all
but
of
the
patients
were
admitted
after
the
initial
episode
and
were
treated
with
parenteral
antimicrobial
drugs
postural
drainage
was
resumed
as
rapidly
as
possible
after
cessation
of
acute
bleeding
vitamin
k
was
administered
to
all
patients
volumes
of
expectorated
blood
were
as
large
as
ml
with
the
initial
episode
blood
pressure
changes
occurred
in
patients
five
patients
received
blood
transfusions
bleeding
stopped
without
surgical
intervention
in
all
patients
usually
within
days
the
patients
had
a
total
of
episodes
of
bleeding
no
surgical
treatment
was
undertaken
at
this
center
one
patient
underwent
a
lobectomoy
at
another
hospital
but
continued
to
bleed
postoperatively
ten
patients
died
mean
survival
after
hemoptysis
years
range
months
to
years
this
survival
rate
is
comparable
to
that
of
another
group
of
patients
with
equally
severe
lung
disease
who
had
never
bled
profusely
the
other
patients
remain
alive
from
months
to
years
after
their
initial
episode
our
dat
suggest
that
massive
hemoptysis
complicating
cystic
fibrosis
may
not
be
as
ominous
an
event
as
has
been
believed
in
the
past
because
of
the
tendency
of
most
patients
to
stop
bleeding
without
aggressive
surgical
intervention
future
studies
of
new
therapeutic
measures
for
massive
hemoptysis
must
have
appropriate
untreated
control
patients
who
receive
only
medical
management
