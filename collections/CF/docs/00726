ciliary

factors
in
cystic
fibrosis
and
asthma
using
a
modified
rabbit
tracheal
bioassay
we
have
confirmed
that
serum
from
individuals
with
bronchial
asthma
and
serum
from
homozygotes
and
heterozygotes
for
cf
cause
ciliary
dyskinesia
whereas
normal
healthy
control
sera
do
not
to
evaluate
the
specificity
of
the
ciliary
dyskinesia
activity
cda
detected
we
bioassayed
serum
from
eight
patients
with
bronchial
asthma
we
found
that
all
eight
asthmatic
sera
caused
a
ciliary
dyskinesia
reaction
however
sera
from
asthmatics
generally
caused
a
subsequent
ciliostasis
cessation
of
ciliary
beating
concurrent
evaluation
of
all
sera
for
cda
by
bioassay
and
for
cystic
fibrosis
protein
cfp
by
electrofocusing
showed
that
all
cda
positive
sera
except
seven
of
the
eight
asthmatic
sera
were
also
positive
for
cfp
our
specific
marker
for
the
cf
gene
these
two
finding
indicated
that
the
activity
detected
in
patients
with
asthma
and
other
respiratory
diseases
could
be
a
substance
different
from
a
cf
specific
cdf
to
test
our
hypothesis
we
set
out
to
purify
the
cdas
in
asthmatic
cf
homozygote
and
ohcf
sera
representative
results
clearly
indicate
that
the
asthmatic
cda
is
found
in
deae
ii
and
sephadex
g
fraction
ii
whereas
the
cda
found
in
cf
and
ohcf
sera
elutes
in
deae
i
and
sephadex
g
fractions
iii
and
iv
weak
cda
we
conclude
that
the
cdas
in
asthma
and
cf
are
distinct
substances
our
findings
may
facilitate
purification
of
what
we
feel
is
a
cf
specific
cdf
from
cf
and
ohcf
serum
purification
is
a
prerequisite
to
elucidating
the
exact
nature
of
this
substance
and
its
role
in
the
pathophysiology
of
cf
