quantitative
assessment
of
regional
ventilation
and
perfusion
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
twenty
five
children
aged
months
to
years
were
studied
to
determine
the
usefulness
of
computer
assisted
ventilation
perfusion
v
p
scanning
in
analysis
of
regional
pulmonary
function
in
cystic
fibrosis
ventilation
and
perfusion
scintiphotographs
were
compared
with
the
patients
radiographs
regional
fractional
exchanges
of
air
and
relative
regional
v
p
ratios
were
obtained
whole
lung
air
exchange
was
significantly
correlated
with
standard
pulmonary
function
tests
and
radiograph
scores
ventilation
perfusion
ratio
gradients
were
reversed
in
pats
with
predominantly
upper
zone
disease
and
regional
v
p
ratios
were
uneven
in
distribution
quantitative
assessment
of
regional
ventilation
and
perfusion
is
a
useful
technique
for
assessing
severity
of
pulmonary
disease
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
