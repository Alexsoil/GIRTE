aggregation
and
precipitation
of
capp
in
saliva
of
patients
with

seems
to
be
induced
primarily
by
elevated
levels
of
calcium
in

this
precipitation
may
be
entirely
or
in
part
responsible
for
focal
obstruction

submaxillary
gland
ducts
in
patients
with

however
little
or
no
capp
is
secreted
in
the
lower
gastrointestinal

tracheobronchial
tracts
therefore
capp
does
not
play
a
more
general
role

which
