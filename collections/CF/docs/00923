we
confirm
that
thymidine
requiring
thy
staphylococcus
aureus
strains
are
common
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
in
months
we
isolated
staph
aureus
from
of
patients
with
c
f
despite
long
term
co
trimoxazole
staph
aureus
tends
to
persist
in
the
sputum
even
though
isolates
do
not
require
thymidine
at
first
and
are
trimethoprim
sensitive
in
vitro
staph
aureus
is
less
commonly
isolated
and
of
less
significance
in
most
other
chest
conditions
for
which
co
trimoxazole
is
given
these
factors
may
explain
why
thy
staphylococci
are
recognised
more
frequently
in
c
f
than
in
other
diseases
