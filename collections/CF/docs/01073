clinical
and
radiological
findings
quantified
by
special
scores
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
are
compared
with
lung
function
measurements
including
the
ratio
of
rv
tlc
and
fev
vc
and
the
arterial
blood
gases
at
rest
and
during
exercise
although
respiratory
function
tests
were
found
to
correlate
well
with
both
the
pulmonary
finding
score
and
the
chest
radiographic
score
distinction
of
three
severity
groups
was
possible
only
by
a
vector
calculation
of
the
blood

in

at
rest
and

thus
measurements
of
po
and
pco
at
rest
and
on
exercise
appear
to
be
a
helpful
adjuvant
to
routine
spirometry
for
the
individual

of
the
