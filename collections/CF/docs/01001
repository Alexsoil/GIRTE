turner
and

cited
cystic
fibrosis
as
an
example
of
the
application
of
the
judicious
use
of
genetic
counseling
and
prenatal
diagnosis
the
reader
who
is
unfamiliar
with
genetic
disorders
prenatal
diagnosis
and
genetic
counseling
may
have
taken
the
cystic
fibrosis
example
as
fact
rather
than
a
model
as
intended
cystic
fibrosis
is
a
recessive
disorder
for
which
prenatal
diagnosis
and
heterozygote
detection
are
not
yet
possible
currently
because
of
the
present
inability
to
detect
the
heterozygous
state
genetic
counseling
of
individuals
with
a
family
history
of
cystic
fibrosis
frequently
means
a
statistical
prediction
is
given
rather
than
a
precise
recurrence
risk
