inborn
errors
of
metabolism
are
conditions
in
which
the
body
fails
to
metabolise
certain
chemicals
due
to
an
inherited
enzyme
deficiency
the
inborn
errors
of
metabolism
considered
in
this
paper
are
those
which
affect
the
metabolism
of
dietary
nutrients
and
which
require
manipulation
of
the
carbohydrate
intake
in
these
cases
the
need
for
sugar
either
as
a
source
of
energy
when
other
energy
supplying
nutrients
have
to
be
suppressed
or
for
the
control
of
hypoglycaemia
is
vitally
important
inborn
errors
of
protein
metabolism
include
phenylketonuria
maple
syrup
urine
disease
organic
acidaemias
and
hyperammonaemia
inborn
errors
of
fat
metabolism
include
abetalipoprotinaemia
type
i
lipoprotein
lipase
deficiency
and
lymphangiectasia
inborn
errors
of
carbohydrate
metabolism
include
diabetes
galactosaemia
fructosaemia
and
glucose
phosphate
deficiency
type
i
glycogen
storage
disease
inborn
errors
of
multiple
nutrients
include
cystic
fibrosis
dietary
carbohydrate
psychological
considerations
and
dental
caries
are
examined
