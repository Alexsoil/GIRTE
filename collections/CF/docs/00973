in
previous
studies
cystic
fibrosis
cf
fibroblasts
were
demonstrated
to
be
resistant
to
the
cytotoxic
effects
of
ouabain
dexamethasone
and
the
sex
hormones
dihydrotestosterone
beta
estradiol
and
progesterone
we
now
show
that
cf
fibroblasts
also
exhibit
greatly
increased
resistance
to
the
cytotoxic
effects
of
exogenous
dibutyryl
cyclic
amp
camp
as
well
as
to
isoproterenol
and
theophylline
drugs
which
are
known
to
increase
endogenous
levels
of
camp
cf
cells
were
also
shown
to
have
normal
amounts
of
h
camp
binding
to
protein
kinase
as
well
as
normal
amounts
of

stimulated
protein

activity
phosphodiesterase
in
cf
cells
was
also
found
to
be
stimulated
by
camp
to
the
same
degree
as
in
normal
cells
these
findings
suggest
that
there
is
no
detectable
protein
kinase
deficiency
in
cf
cells
cf
cells
thus
appear
to
be
unlike
some
camp
resistant
mutants
described
by
others
which
are
defective
in
protein
kinase
activity
and
camp
regulation
of
phosphodiesterase
levels
the
cross
resistance
of
cf
fibroblasts
to
ouabain
steroid
hormones
and
camp
may
provide
a
unique
opportunity
to
study
the
biochemical
events
involved
in
the
metabolism
of
these
drugs
as
well
as
the
basic

in
