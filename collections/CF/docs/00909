neonatal
meconium
obstruction
in
the
ileum
without
mucoviscidosis
two
newborns
with
intestinal
obstruction
of
the
terminal
ileum
without
mucoviscidosis
were
cured
by
gastrografin
enema
a
further
case
of
a
premature
infant
showed
at
autopsy
a
large
intestine
containing
normal
meconium
but
an
ileum
which
was
plugged
with
tenacious
meconium
containing
pas
positive
and
alcian
blue
negative
mucus
our
cases
were
similar
to
cases
of
meconium
disease
reported
by
rickham
and
of
meconium
plug
in
the
small
intestine
reported
by
emery
the
primary
cause
of
this
disease
lies
in
the
large
amount
of
pas
positive
mucus
secreted
from
goblet
cells
of
the
ileal
mucosa
and
the
hypertrophy
of
lymph
nodules
in
the
ileal
submucosa
