we
investigated
the
airway
s
response
to
exercise
in
cystic
fibrosis
cf
due
to
the
reported
high
incidence
of
allergy
in

we
tried
to
demonstrate
the
well
documented
post
exercise
bronchospasm
of
asthma
in
patients

on
a
treadmill
for
minutes
at
a
speed
of
miles
per

a
gradient
of
degrees

peak

flow
rate

during

the
mean
fall

during

for
the
eight
atopic
asthmatics

patients

statistically
significant
post

no

post

bronchospasm

there
any
difference

had
positive
skin
tests
to
common
allergens

those
who

in

of
bronchial
liability
it
is
suggested
that
the
general
desensitization
therapy
should
not
be
instituted
in
patients
with

merely
on
the
basis
of
positive
skin
tests
without
more
stringent
criteria
such
as
characteristic
seasonal
variation
in

symptomatology
family
