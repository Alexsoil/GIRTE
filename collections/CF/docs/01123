the
sweat
test
for
cystic
fibrosis
letter
the
major
issue
is
not
the
lack
of
interest
of
clinical
chemists
but
the
actual
performance
of
the
test
neither
the
pathologist
nor
the
clinical
chemist
in
all
likelihood
actually
performs
the
test
rather
it
is
the
medical
technologist
or
technician
who
carries
out
the
actual
procedure
it
is
a
major
part
of
our
roles
as
educators
and
laboratory
administrators
to
ensure
that
these
people
are
adequately
trained
for
the
task
and
that
the
test
meets
high
enough
performance
standards
to
provide
a
clinically
relevant
answer
