false

collections
sweat
tests
collected
on
two
or
more
occasions
from
normal
children
and
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
have
been
analysed
according
to
the
weight
of
sweat
collected
in
five
cases
collections
of
mg
of
sweat
gave
false
negative
results
although
mg
of
sweat
is
considered
adequate
by
some
authorities
our
results
do
not
support
this
the
study
confirms
the
view
that
at
least
mg
of
sweat
must
be
collected
to
give
reliable
results
