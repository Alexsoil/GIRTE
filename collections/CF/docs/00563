the

were
investigated

a

percent

it

the

the

the

the

for
the

appears
to
be
related
to
a

molecule
s
it
does
not
seem
to
reflect
the
presence
of
high
plasma
glucose
levels
in

nor
to
be
the
result
of
competitive
inhibition
between

it
does
not
seem
to
be
the
result
of
sodium
or
other
electrolyte
differences
a
similar
inhibitory
effect
is
acquired
by
normal
plasma
after
the
addition
of

on
the
other
hand
plasma
from
cf
homozygotes
loses
its
inhibitory

after

with

these
findings
may
indicate
that
products
of
metabolic
degradation
of
spermidine
are
responsible
for
the
inhibitory
effect
of
glucose
transport
and
suggest
the
possibility
of
a
role
in
abnormal
polyamine
metabolism
in
the
pathogenesis
of
cystic
