abdominal
complaints
and
appendiceal
changes
leading
to
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
twelve
patients
with
abdominal
complaints
had
an
operation
that
included
incidental
appendectomy
they
were
later
diagnosed
as
having
cystic
fibrosis
four
groups
of
presenting
signs
and
symptoms
were
right
lower
quadrant
mass
chronic
abdominal
pain
intestinal
obstruction
and
hepatomegaly
in
all
cases
the
symptoms
precipitating
operation
were
due
to
the
underlying
unrecognized
condition
cystic
fibrosis
review
of
the
histology
of
the
appendix
revealed
the
classic
changes
of
hypersecretion
of
the
mucous
glands
to
be
present
the
appendix
shares
in
the
generalized
intestinal
mucous
gland
involvement
peculiar
to
cystic
fibrosis
awareness
of
this
fact
has
not
been
widespread
perhaps
because
of
the
usual
emphasis
on
the
pulmonary
and
pancreatic
aspects
of
the
disease
greater
appreciation
of
the
clinical
symptoms
of
cystic
fibrosis
and
more
liberal
use
of
the
sweat
test
could
have
diminished
the
number
of
exploratory
celiotomies
recognition
of
the
histoloc
changes
in
the
removed
appendices
can
also
suggest
the
proper
diagnosis
and
lead
to
earlier
institution
of
treatment
with
an
improved
prognosis
