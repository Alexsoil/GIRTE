the
paradoxical
effect
of
adrenergic
and
methylxanthine
drugs
in
cystic
fibrosis
this
study
examined
the
effect
of
aerosolized
isoproterenol
and
oral
theophylline
on
pulmonary
function
in
cystic
fibrosis
cf
to
determine
how
often
these
drugs
are
beneficial
and
whether
there
is
a
correlation
between
response
to
isoproterenol
and
response
to
oral
theophylline
after
obtaining
baseline
pulmonary
function
tests
before
and
after
isoproterenol
aerosol
patients
with
cf
were
put
on
a
double
blind
trial
of
high
dosage
theophylline
mg
kg
three
times
per
day
or
placebo
for
four
weeks
and
were
then
switched
to
the
alternate
regimen
for
the
next
four
weeks
patients
had
weekly
evaluations
of
pulmonary
function
and
plasma
theophylline
determinations
gastrointestinal
side
effects
were
common
with
theophylline
the
responses
to
aerosolized
bronchodilators
were
inconsistent
from
week
to
week
after
aerosolized
bronchodilator
five
of
patients
had
an
average
increase
of
or
more
in
fef
and
fef
while
taking
oral
theophylline
five
patients
had
a
or
more
decrease
in
fef
and
six
patients
had
a
decrease
in
fef
we
conclude
that
there
was
no
concordance
between
response
to
isoproterenol
and
theophylline
and
that
adrenergic
and
methylxanthine
drugs
must
be
used
with
caution
in
patients
with
cf
