enzymatic
detection
of
a
ciliostatic
factor
the
ciliostatic
cystic
fibrosis
cf
factor
has
been
investigated
in
order
to
develop
an
enzymatic
assay
for
its
detection
in
saliva
this
factor
is
associated
with
alpha
amylase
removal
or
addition
of
the
factor
by
dialysis
does
not
affect
the
alpha
amylase
catalytic
activity
of
cf
or
control
normal
saliva
crude
preparations
of
the
dialyzable
factor
from
cf
saliva
are
ciliostatic
alpha
amylase
catalyzed
starch
hydrolysis
from
both
cf
and
control
saliva
was
found
to
be
insensitive
to
hydroxyalkylamine
inhibitors
so
this
method
could
not
be
used
to
detect
differences
in
cf
and
control
amylase
since
another
carbohydrase
mammalian
debranching
enzyme
is
much
more
sensitive
to
inhibition
the
effect
of
the
isolated
crude
factor
on
this
enzyme
was
determined
the
mean
values
for
percentage
of
inhibition
of
debranching
enzyme
activity
by
fractions
obtained
from
saliva
of
cf
patients
obligate
heterozygotes
and
control
subjects
are
samples
samples
and
samples
respectively
fifteen
of
the
cf
values
exceed
the
maximum
inhibition
observed
for
controls
indeed
five
samples
almost
completely
inhibited
debranching
enzyme
this
inhibitory
action
provides
the
basis
of
an
enzymatic
assay
for
the
detection
of
the
ciliostatic
cf
factor
