letter
in
an
effort
to
determine
whether
increased
permeability
to
calcium
ions
could
explain
the
cystic
fibrosis
serum
ciliary
dyskensia
factor
response
in
the
tracheal
test
system
we
selectively
increased
the
membrane
permeability
of
the
tracheal
epithelium
to
calcium
ions
by
adding
calcium
ionophore
a
to
the
tracheal
culture
medium
these
studies
determined
that
calcium
ionophore
a
in
culture
medium
produced
a
change
in
mucociliary
function
in
the
tracheal
test
system
indistinguishable
from
that
promoted
by
c
f
sera
these
investigations
which
are
now
being
extended
to
include
the
ultrastructural
alterations
induced
in
the
epithelium
of
the
rabbit
tracheal
bioassay
system
point
to
an
important
role
for
calcium
as
a
cofactor
in
the
production
of
the
c
d
f
response
generated
by
the
c
f
sera
the
c
f
serum
substance
seems
to
act
at
the
cellular
membrane
level
promoting
membrane
permeability
changes
at
least
with
respect
to
calcium
in
the
rabbit
tracheal
test
system
such
a
mechanism
would
not
necessarily
result
in
a
net
physiological
imbalance
of
calcium
in
the
rabbit
tracheal
system
but
only
local
changes
in
calcium
concentration
that
would
subsequently
alter
secretion
and
microtubular
function
since
c
f
serum
like
sweat
and
saliva
from
these
same
patients
can
promote
ionic
fluxes
perhaps
there
is
a
common
factor
in
all
these
body
fluids
which
is
related
to
the
basic
defect
in
c
f
it
is
tempting
to
speculate
that
such
a
factor
produces
a
membrane
associated
phenomenon
that
may
be
generally
representative
of
the
in
vivo
c
f
disorder
and
as
such
may
reflect
the
nature
of
the
cellular
and
glandular
abnormalities
of
the
disease
