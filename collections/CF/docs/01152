a
new
percussion
aid
for
cystic
fibrosis
patients
this
paper
is
a
report
on
the
first
part
of
a
comprehensive
research
programme
the
aim
is
the
development
of
a
mechanical
aid
which
will
enable
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
to
give
themselves
satisfactory
physiotherapy
the
percussor
which
can
be
used
by
patients
parents
or
relatives

portable
and
lightweight
the
domiciliary
trial
showed
that
effective
percussion
could
be
self
administered
to
the
front

the
chest
and
to
a
lesser
extent
to
the
sides
of
the
chest
the
percussor
was
found
to
be
very
acceptable
to
adolescent
patients
and
especially
girls
with
early
breast
development
further
research
work
has
now
been
completed
and
as
a
result
a
system
has
been
developed
which
enables
patients
to
treat
themselves
with
satisfactory
chest
percussion
in
the
five
preferred
positions
of
postural
drainage
