alterations
in
the
golgi
complex
and
glycoprotein
biosynthesis
in
normal
and
diseased
tissues
the
golgi
complex
has
an
important
role
in
the
regulation
and
normal
development
of
the
cell
contributing
to
anabolic
functions
including
the
assembly
and
secretion
of
macromolecules
and
to
catabolic
functions
in
the
synthesis
of
lysosomes
the
central
role
of
the
golgi
complex
in
the
biosynthesis
of
glycoproteins
has
been
demonstrated
the
purpose
of
this
review
is
to
focus
attention
on
the
structural
and
functional
correlation
of
the
golgi
complex
in
the
liver
in
relation
to
its
involvement
in
disease
the
hepatic
parenchymal
cell
has
been
used
widely
as
a
model
to
study
biosynthetic
absorptive
and
secretory
functions
of
epithelial
cell
types
the
studies
are
grouped
under
five
broad
headings
structural
organization
development
and
differentiation
ultrastructural
changes
in
pathologic
conditions
alterations
in
glycoprotein
biosynthesis
and
alterations
in
glycosyltransferases
