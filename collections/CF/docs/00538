fatty
acids
prostaglandins
and
cystic
fibrosis
the
papers
by
elliott
and
by
campbell
et
al
suggest
a
new
approach
toward
etiology
pathophysiology
and
therapy
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
as
in
elliott
s
original
report
of
the
effects
of
intravenous
fatty
acid
therapy
for
cf
the
patients
in
the
present
report
fared
remarkably
well
particularly
in
regard
to
weight
gain
the
paper
of
campbell
et
al
suggests
that
oxygen
does
not
simply
diffuse
across
membranes
but
that
instead
its
transport
is
influenced
by
the
fatty
acid
composition
of
the
membrane
elliott
s
suggestion
that
the
disarranged
fatty
acid
metabolism
may
be
related
to
altered
prostaglandin
production
is
attractive
these
studies
do
not
prove
whether
fatty
acid
and
or
prostaglandin
alterations
are
secondary
to
intestinal
fat
malabsorption
or
are
related
to
the
primary
metabolic
defect
