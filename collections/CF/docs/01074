complement
in
cystic
fibrosis
quantitative
and
functional
assessments
were
made
of
both
the
classical
and
alternative
pathways
of
complement
activation
in
sera
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
classical
pathway
functioned
similarly
in
patients
and
controls
as
measured
by
ch
titre
alternative
pathway
function
initiated
in
patient
sera
by
incubation
with
inulin
was
equal
to
that
of
controls
as
determined
by
cleavage
of
factor
b
and
c
and
by
the
consumption
of
terminal
components
factor
b
however
was
more
readily
activated
in
patient
than
in
control
sera
this
rapid
alteration
of
factor
b
did
not
lead
to
accelerated
or
more
extensive
activation
of
the
terminal
complement
components
via
the
alternative
pathway
when
assessed
by
c
cleavage
and
the
consumption
of
terminal
components
thus
a
complement
deficiency
was
not
found
the
importance
of
the
easily
activated
factor
b
is
undefined
