primary
peritonitis
in
infancy
and
childhood
primary
peritonitis
rarely
diagnosed
preoperatively
is
an
uncommon
disease
accounting
for
of
all
pediatric
abdominal
emergencies
it
is
often
associated
with
urinary
or
hepatic
pathology
the
former
the
source
of
the
infecting
organism
in
the
majority
of
cases
and
presents
with
characteristic
symptoms
depending
upon
whether
it
occurs
in
infancy
or
childhood
the
symptoms
and
signs
which
allow
for
a
positive
prospective
diagnosis
are
illustrated
by
comparing
this
disease
to
those
entities
with
which
it
is
most
often
confused
e
g
diffuse
peritonitis
of
other
etiologies
and
include
a
short
duration
of
symptoms
associated
urinary
tract
infection
and
an
absence
of
free
air
on
abdominal
roentgenograms
in
the
past
gram
positive
organisms
were
the
most
common
infecting
agent
however
in
this
series
gram
negative
bacteria
accounted
for
or
the
organisms
antibiotics
with
a
gram
negative
spectrum
and
exploratory
laparotomy
with
appendectomy
are
the
hallmarks
of
therapy
the
latter
replaced
by
abdominal
tap
only
in
the
patient
who
satisfies
the
criteria
for
primary
peritonitis
and
in
whom
an
associated
disease
makes
the
risk
of
surgery
prohibitive
