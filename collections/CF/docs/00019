plasma
arginine
esterase
activity
in
cystic
fibrosis
we
assayed
the
serum
of
a
group
of
cystic
fibrosis
patients
that
were
on
oral
arginine
therapy
and
that
of
a
group
of
cystic
fibrosis
patients
that
were
not
receiving
this
treatment
for
total
arginine
esterase
activity
the
untreated
cystic
fibrosis
patients
have
significantly
lower
serum
arginine
esterase
activity
than
the
normal
controls
the
cystic
fibrosis
carriers
and
the
cystic
fibrosis
patients
receiving
oral
arginine
therapy
there
is
no
significant
difference
between
the
arginine
esterase
activity
of
the
normal
controls
and
the
cystic
fibrosis
carriers
or
the
cystic
fibrosis
patients
treated
with
arginine
we
have
recently
observed
differences
in
the
arginine
esterases
in
plasma
of
controls
and
patients
by
electrofusing
on
polyacrylamide
gels
six
activity
bands
could
be
detected
in
plasma
of
controls
whereas
only
five
could
be
detected
in
plasma
of
patients
our
work
on
the
deficiency
of
trypsin
like
activity
in
mixed
saliva
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
has
been
reproduced
by
another
laboratory
coburn
recently
confirmed
our
work
on
deficiency
of
arginine
esterase
in
serum
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
at
present
the
deficiency
of
arginine
esterase
in
cystic
fibrosis
is
a
working
hypothesis
to
understand
the
basic
defect
the
variations
of
ph
and
sodium
chloride
content
that
i
employed
had
been
tested
by
me
in
patients
both
with
and
without
a
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
and
were
found
not
to
alter
the
level
of
arginine
esterase
activity
the
major
differences
between
the
two
studies
resulted
from
the
control
subjects
dr
rao
neglects
to
mention
the
few
other
laboratories
that
were
unable
to
confirm
his
findings
