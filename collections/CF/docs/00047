elasticity
of
sputum
has
been
determined
using
the
weissenberg
rheogoniometer
by
oscillatory
testing
over
frequencies
from
to
c
s
sputum
was
from
patients
with
either
asthma
chronic
bronchitis
cystic
fibrosis
or
bronchiectasis
and
macroscopically
mucoid
mucopurulent
or
purulent
as
in
the
viscosity
plot
over
this
shear
rate
range
two
zones
with
a
junctional
region
can
be
distinguished
in
zone
over
the
lowest
shear
rates
elasticity
increases
slowly
changes
little
over
a
plateau
region
and
then
in
zone
increases
sharply
in
contrast
to
the
viscosity
plot
the
plateau
does
not
show
nothing
by
c
s
some
samples
show
decreasing
elasticity
although
variance
between
samples
is
wide
there
is
no
level
of
elasticity
characteristic
of
each
disease
or
of
one
macroscopic
appearance
elasticity
and
viscosity
are
correlated
most
significantly
at
the
lowest
shear
rates
asthmatic
and
bronchiectatic
sputa
resemble
each
other
in
that
this
correlation
is
still
significant
at
higher
shear
rates
cystic
fibrosis
and
chronic
bronchitic
sputum
in
that
it
is
not
since
in
these
last
two
mucous
gland
hypertrophy
is
present
it
may
be
that
the
sputum
has
a
higher
mucus
component
