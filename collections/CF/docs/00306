activity
after

to

this

to

the

the

treatment

gave
values

myeloperoxidase
release
which
are

studies
of

samples
demonstrated
that
degranulating
ability
and
the
presence
of
cilicary
dyskinesia
as
assessed
by

bioassay
are
not
always
associated
therefore
the
relationship
between
pre
cdf
and
the
degranulator
activity
in
native
cf
affected
and
carrier
sera
is
unclear
in
part
because
of
the
limitations
inherent
in
the

employed
