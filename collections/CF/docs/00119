skin
wrinkling
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
water
binding
capacity
of
a
protein
is
minimal
at
its
isoelectric
point
ph
for
the
keratins
making
up
the
horny
layers
and
increases
with
increasing
divergence
from
the
isoelectric
point
it
is
for
this
reason
that
normal
palmar
skin
wrinkles
after
moderate
immersion
in
warm
water
especially
if
it
is
soapy
ph
or
more
however
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
it
is
the
increased
salt
content
of
the
sweat
rather
than
the
ph
difference
which
increases
the
water
binding
capacity
of
the
keratin
and
is
responsible
for
the
wrinkling
in
these
patients
