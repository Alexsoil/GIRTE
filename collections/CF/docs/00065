sweat
chloride
values
examined
with
orion
direct
reading
skin
electrode
were
collected
in
a
group
of
normal
persons
and
a
group
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
were
evaluated
for
differences
attributable
to
age
and
sex
in
the
normal
group
no
significant
difference
was
found
between
the
two
sexes
in
the
normal
group
the
values
among
newborns
are
found
to
be
considerably
higher
than
in
the
rest
of
childhood
during
the
first
month
of
life
the
values
decrease
to
a
steady
level
which
is
maintained
from
the
age
of
month
to
years
after
the
age
of
a
steady
increase
takes
place
with
data
gathered
from
the
normal
group
we
propose
the
following
upper

upon
examination
of

the
