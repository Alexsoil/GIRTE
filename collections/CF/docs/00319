studies
in
meconium
disaccharidase
activities
in
meconium
from
cystic
fibrosis
patients
and
controls
meconium
ileus
represents
the
earliest
clinical
manifestation
of
cystic
fibrosis
the
differences
found
in
the
composition
and
amount
of
protein
mucoprotein
mucopolysaccharides
and
reducing
sugars
in
meconium
from
newborns
with
cystic
fibrosis
might
be
of
significance
relative
to
the
pathogenesis
and
early
diagnosis
of
this
disease
we
studied
the
enzymatic
activity
of
disaccharidases
lactase
sucrase
maltase
and
palatinase
in
meconium
of
infants
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
controls
we
found
an
increase
in
the
specific
activity
of
these
enzymes
in
the
meconium
from
infants
with
cystic
fibrosis
as
compared
to
the
specific
activity
in
meconium
from
normal
infants
the
increase
in
the
activities
expressed
as
micromols
per
gram
of
protein
per
minute
was
lactase
times
higher
sucrase
times
maltase
times
and
palatinase
times
