pulmonary
function
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
was
assessed
by
the
arterial
alveolar
pn
difference
adjusted
to
sublingual
temperature
the
resulting
values
were
compared
with
the
alveolar

po

arterial
pco
and
standard
measurements
of
lung
volume
flow
and
diffusing
capacity
the
arterial
alveolar
pn
difference
was
nearly
one
half
of
the
po
difference
both
early
in
the
disease
and
at
a
more
advanced
stage
analysis
taking
into
account
the
o
dissociation
curve
and
the
possibility
that
alveolar
temperature
is
higher
than
sublingual
temperature
suggested
that
all
of
the

could
be
explained
in

of

suggested
that
the

in

may
be
explained
by
ventilation

inequality
a
significant
relationship
between
arterial
pco
and
the
pn
difference
supported
the
view
that
ventilation
perfusion
inequality
is
the
cause
of
co
retention
when
present
the
pn
and
po
differences
were
abnormal
before
the
standard
tests
of
lung
volume
and
flow
but
in
general
the
correlation
was
excellent
because
the
pn
difference
was
not
superior
to
the
po
difference
in
detecting
early
disease
and
because
the
technical
problems
in
its
measurement
are
considerable
it
is
not
recommended
as
a
routine
measurement
