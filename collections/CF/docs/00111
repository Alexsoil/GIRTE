nitroblue
tetrazolium
test
in
cystic
fibrosis
it
has
been
claimed
that
the
nitroblue
tetrazolium
n
b
t
test
is
of
value
in
the
surveillance
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
a
positive
test
giving
evidence
of
active
bacterial
infection
which
may
not
be
apparent
clinically
and
not
made
evident
by
such
investigations
as
the
white
blood
cell
count
sputum
culture
and
chest
x
ray
the
test
was
therefore
included
in
the
routine
assessment
of
patients
attending
this
clinic
of
the
total
n
b
t
tests
were
positive
in
only
of
these
cases
was
there
other
evidence
of
infection
these
were
treated
with
antibiotics
the
remaining
were
left
untreated
of
these
remained
completely
free
of
infection
by
standard
criteria
at
subsequent
review
in
cases
however
the
patient
developed
obvious
infection
before
the
next
clinic
visit
it
could
be
argued
that
in
those
cases
the
n
b
t
test
had
given
early
evidence
of
infection
not
otherwise
apparent
this
is
by
no
means
certain
since
the
onset
of
infection
could
have
been
at
any
time
during
the
four
week
interval
in
our
experience
the
n
b
t
has
been
of
little
help
in
the
management
of
cystic
fibrosis
there
were
in
this
series
false
negatives
and
at
least
false
positives
some
of
which
had
very
high
counts
it
is
possible
however
that
in
i
e
of
the
tests
carried
out
the
n
b
t
gave
early
indication
of
infection
not
otherwise
suspected
