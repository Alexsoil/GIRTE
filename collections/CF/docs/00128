home
care
for
cf
patients
nearly
all
agree
that
home
therapy
which
permits
cystic
fibrosis
children
to
lead
nearly
normal
lives
is
desirable
between
hospital
visits
it
s
also
essential
for
warding
off
the
primary
threats
of
cf
pulmonary
insufficiency
and
cor
pulmonale
treatment
is
palliative
focusing
on
supplying
enzymes
that
the
body
can
t
secrete
and
when
the
lungs
are
involved
clearing
airway
obstructions
the
first
step
in
therapy
is
starting
the
child
on
supplemental
enzymes
which
will
enable
him
to
absorb
fat
and
protein
usually
we
encourage
a
normal
diet
if
x
rays
pulmonary
function
tests
or
clinical
observation
shows
lung
involvement
we
initiate
pulmonary
therapy
and
teach
parents
how
to
perform
it
at
home
postural
drainage
is
continued
indefinitely
even
if
the
lungs
clear
if
the
child
shows
clinical
signs
of
infection
we
instruct
the
parents
to
increase
the
number
of
active
mist
and
postural
drainage
treatments
and
to
administer
oral
antibiotics
in
high
doses
above
all
we
instruct
the
parents
of
cf
children
to
treat
them
as
normally
as
possible
