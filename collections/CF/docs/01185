reports

secretory
anomalies
in
cystic
fibrosis
and
increased
calcium
ion
concentrations
in
some
cf
secretions
and
the
importance
of
cellular
ca
to
stimulus
secretion
coupling
led
us
to
study
cellular
ca
in
cf
we
report
data
on
ca
uptake
studies
with
mitochondrial
and
microsomal
fractions
isolated
from
skin
fibroblasts
of
subjects
with
cf

age
sex
and
passage
number
matched
controls
in
which
mitochondria
from
cf
cells
accumulated
more
ca
than
those
from
control
cells
we
also
describe
subsequent
studies
which
show
increased
mitochondrial
electron
transport
activity
measured
as
oxygen
uptake
by
whole
cells
in
cells
from
subjects
with

obligate
heterozygotes
one
can
hypothesise
a
mechanism
to
link
the
altered
mitochondrial
ca
in
cf
fibroblasts
and
the
major
signs
associated
with
the
disease
data
suggest
that
the
electron
transport
system
in
cf
and
obligate
heterozygote
fibroblasts
is
more
active
than
that
in
respective
controls
in
the
conditions
of
this
study
the
apparent
central
role
of
ca
in
several
pathogenetic
pathways
in
cf
and
the
data
reported
here
in
which
both
mitochondrial
ca
capacity
and
oxygen
consumption
are
increased
in
cf
suggest
that
this

is
a
suitable
focus
for
cf
