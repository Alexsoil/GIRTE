amylase
content
of
mixed
saliva
in
children
salivary
amylase
levels
were
determined
in
normal
subjects
from
birth
until
adult
life
and
in
children
with
conditions
sometimes
associated
with
low
pancreatic
amylase
such
as
malnutrition
coeliac
disease
and
cystic
fibrosis
mixed
saliva
was
collected
under
carefully
standardised
conditions
and
amylase
was
measured
by
the
method
of
dahlqvist
there
was
a
wide
scatter
of
values
in
the
normal
subjects
but
concentrations
rose
from
very
low
levels
at
birth
to
reach
adult
levels
by
the
age
of
months
to
year
salivary
amylase
activity
rose
normally
over
ten
weeks
in
one
premature
infant
fed
milk
by
gastrostomy
thirteen
children
with
coeliac
disease
and
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
mostly
had
normal
salivary
amylase
concentrations
six
out
of
malnourished
children
with
jejunal
villous
atrophy
of
uncertain
aetiology
had
low
levels
which
rose
to
normal
as
recovery
began
