inbreeding
in
recessive
diseases
the
consanguinity
of
parents
born
in
france
of
individuals
who
have
a
recessive
disease
has
been
studied
the
frequency
of
first
cousin
marriages
is
less
than
in
the
general
french
population
among
the
parents
of
affected
individuals
the
following
frequencies
of
first
cousin
matings
were
observed
cystic
fibrosis
cystinosis
nephronophtisis
spinal
muscular
atrophy
albinism
achromatopsia
albinism
and
spinal
muscular
atrophy
are
heterogeneous
conditions
the
increase
in
the
frequency
of
first
cousin
marriage
relative
to
that
of
the
general
population
is
much
greater
as
expected
in
cystinosis
which
is
a
rare
disease
than
in
cystic
fibrosis
which
is
the
most
frequent
recessive
disorder
in
france
inbreeding
in
cystinosis
and
cystic
fibrosis
was
also
studied
by
computing
the
distance
between
parental
birth
places
this
distance
is
smaller
in
cystinosis
than
in
cystic
fibrosis
