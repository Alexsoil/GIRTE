abnormal
fatty
acid
composition
of
plasma
lipids
in
cystic
fibrosis
a
primary
or
a
secondary
defect
the
percentage
fatty
acid
composition
of
the
various
plasma
lipid
fractions
from
cystic
fibrosis
patients
with
and
without
pancreatic
insufficiency
obligate
heterozygotes
and
normal
subjects
was
determined
only
the
cystic
fibrosis
patients
with
pancreatic
insufficiency
had
significantly
abnormal
fatty
acid
composition
this
general
observation
did
not
correlate
with
vitamin
e
deficiency
age
sex
or
severity
of
the
disease
thus
the
altered
fatty
acid
composition
of
the
different
plasma
lipid
fractions
appears
to
be
a
secondary
consequence
of
the
pancreatic
insufficiency
commonly
associated
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
not
a
direct
metabolic
defect
related
to
the
cystic
fibrosis
gene
itself
