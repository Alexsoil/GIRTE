paba
screening
test
for
exocrine
pancreatic
function
in
infants
and
children
p
amino
benzoic
acid
paba
is
split
specifically
by
pancreatic
chymotrypsin
from
the
synthetic
tripeptide
n
benzoyl
l
tyrosyl
paba
the
urinary
excretion
of
absorbed
paba
serves
as
an
index
for
exocrine
pancreatic
function
the
peptide
g
kg
was
administered
orally
to
controls
aged
between
months
and
years
patients
with
exocrine
pancreatic
insufficiency
caused
by
cystic
fibrosis
cf
and
newborn
infants
in
the
controls
the
mean
hour
paba
recovery
was
sd
recovery
in
patients
with
cf
was
lower
p
less
than
with
no
overlap
in
newborn
infants
the
mean
hour
paba
recovery
was
sd
overlapping
in
instances
with
the
results
in
cf
patients
this
simple
noninvasive
test
thus
appears
promising
and
merits
further
investigation
in
younger
infants
especially
newborns
