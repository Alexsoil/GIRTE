the
typical
shortcomings
of
an
assay
measuring
biological
activity
have
been
studied
and
the
means
to
overcome
the

of
the
oyster
gill
cilia
assay
have
been
established
the
presence
of
the
cystic

mucociliary
inhibitor
cfmi
in
experimental
fractions
may
be
determined
by
accepting
data
from
only
those
assays
in
which
authentic
cf
and
normal
non
cf
fractions
give
defined
reactions
by
measuring
the
reaction
of
each
sample
at
least
three
times
and
by
examining
each
experimental
sample
at
a
protein
concentration
greater
than
the
minimum
established
in
this
study
the
relative
concentrations
of
the
cfmi
present
in
the

of

of

have
been
calculated
in

of

generally
the

ciliary

utilizing

are
essential
