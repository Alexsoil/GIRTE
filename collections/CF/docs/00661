classification
at
time
of
diagnosis
and
subsequent
survival
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
survival
rates
in
patients
suffering
from
cystic
fibrosis
observed
between
january
and
june
were
recorded
the
patients
were
divided
into
five
groups
according
to
the
symptoms
present
at
the
time
of
diagnosis
and
survival
rates
were
recorded
separately
for
each
group
survival
was
less
good
in
the
group
of
patients
presenting
initially
with
pulmonary
symptoms
compared
to
the
group
presenting
with
gastrointestinal
symptoms
in
the
group
presenting
with
meconium
ileus
survival
was
poor
initially
but
later
in
the
course
of
the
disease
it
became
similar
to
that
observed
in
the
other
groups
the
differences
in
survival
between
the
different
categories
occurred
during
the
first
two
years
after
diagnosis
the
study
shows
that
on
clinical
grounds
a
severe
form
of
the
disease
which
is
characterized
by
early
manifestation
of
pulmonary
symptoms
and
poor
survival
can
be
distinguished
from
a
more
protracted
form
with
a
better
survival
because
of
the
great
inter
individual
variability
large
numbers
of
patients
will
have
to
be
evaluated
in
order
to
achieve
statistically
significant
results
in
studies
which
attempt
to
compare
different
therapeutic
approaches
if
such
numbers
cannot
be
reached
it
may
be
necessary
to
compare
only
patients
who
belong
to
the
same
symptomatic
category
