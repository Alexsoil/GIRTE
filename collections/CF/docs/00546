bronchial
drainage
with
aerosol
medications
in
cystic
fibrosis
examined
in
this
study
are
the
immediate
effects
of
bronchial
drainage
preceded
by
the
inhalation
of
aerosol
solutions
of
a
mucolytic
agent
a
bronchodilator
and
their
combination
upon
four
measures
of
pulmonary
function
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
on
three
separate
occasions
pulmonary
function
was
tested
preceding
and
following
treatments
consisting
of
one
of
the
above
three
aerosol
solutions
followed
by
bronchial
drainage
the
order
of
solutions
used
was
random
and
each
subject
received
one
treatment
with
each
solution
the
greatest
overall
improvement
in
function
was
seen
with
the
bronchodilator
and
bronchial
drainage
the
combination
of
the
bronchodilator
mucolytic
agents
and
bronchial
drainage
was
the
next
most
effective
technique
the
mucolytic
agent
when
used
alone
with
bronchial
drainage
decreased
function
comparison
of
the
pulmonary
function
scores
indicated
a
significant
difference
among
the
three
treatments
