sera
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
classified
according
to
fibroblast
metachromasia
into
three
classes
have
been
analysed
immunochemically
for
the
concentrations
of
serum
proteins
in
addition
the
clinical
and
radiological
status
of
the
lungs
were
evaluated
using
two
scoring
systems
eleven
of
serum
proteins
differed
from
the
values
of
a
thousand
donor
serum
pool
the
most
pronounced
differences
from
the
control
sera
were
elevated
acute
phase
proteins
notably
haptoglobin
alpha
antichymotrypsin
igg
and
iga
and
low
serum
albumin
and
alpha
hs
glycoprotein
patients
from
metachromatic
class
iii
presented
the
most
pronounced
rise
in
acute
phase
proteins
and
furthermore
significantly
decreased
complement
c
and
igm
igg
and
iga
were
normal
in
class
iii
patients
these
differences
from
the
control
sera
possibly
reflect
inflammatory
tissue
damage
involving
immune
reactions
the
clinical
score
was
positively
correlated
to
the
radiologic
score
and
both
these
scores
were
positively
correlated
to
the
concentrations
of
eight
and
seven
respectively
of
the
serum
proteins
and
negatively
correlated
to
three
of
the
serum
proteins
based
upon
the
correlations
between
the
scores
and
the
concentrations
of
some
of
the
serum
proteins
it
is
recommended
that
longitudinal
prospective
studies
follow
individual
patients
for
the
concentrations
in
serum
of
haptoglobin
albumin
iga
igg
c
and
eventually
igm
and
alpha
antichymotrypsin
the
present
results
suggest
that
these
serum
proteins
will
yield
valuable
information
as
regards
prognosis
and
therapy
of
the
lung
