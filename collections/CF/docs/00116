skin
wrinkling
in
cystic
fibrosis
professor
elliott
and
dr
norman
and
his
colleagues
suggested
that
excessive
wrinkling
of
the
skin
after
soaking
in
tap
water
might
provide
an
easy
cheap
and
probably
reliable
screening
test
for
cystic
fibrosis
our
results
show
that
this
not
true
marked
wrinkling
after
immersion
of
the
fingers
in
warm
tap
water
for
minutes
was
observed
in
randomly
selected
children
with
a
wide
variety
of
conditions
including
not
only
cystic
fibrosis
but
also
malnutrition
and
renal
heart
endocrine
collagen
and
other
diseases
it
was
elicited
even
in
apparently
healthy
individuals
both
young
and
adult
