tests
for
airways
obstruction
based
on
a
forced
expiration
were
carried
out
in
children
with
asthma
and
with
cystic
fibrosis
to
determine
which
test
or
tests
were
the
best
in
identifying
children
with
airways
disease
to
determine
the
severity
of

and
to

measured
from

and

measured
from

were
the

combined
with

rate
measured
with
