the
levels
of
galactosyltransferase
activity
in
sera
from

children
and

with
cystic
fibrosis
the
levels
of
galactosyltransferase
have
been
studied
in
the
sera
obtained
from
normal
individuals
varying
in
age
from
years
and
from
cystic
fibrosis
patients
varying
in
age
from
years
the
enzyme
level
found
in
children
was
lower
than
that
in
adults
the
levels
in
the
sera
of
cystic
fibrosis
patients
was
found
to
be
about
half
of
that
in
the
normal
sera
for
the
corresponding
age
group
in
those
cystic

patients
over

of
age
normal
