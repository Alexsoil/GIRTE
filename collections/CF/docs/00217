professor

chandra
and
others
found
raised
serum
levels
of
alpha
fetoprotein
afp
in
a
heterozygote
carrier
of
the
gene
for
cystic
fibrosis
and
in
patients
with
the
disease
and
some
of
the
siblings
our
results
do
not
show
any
significant
difference
in
afp
levels
in
patients
siblings
parents
or
control
children
probably
the
discrepancy
in
the
findings
will
be
explained
by
more
detailed
examination
of
the
technique
used
