hemorrhagic
retinopathy
in
a
patient
with
cystic
fibrosis
a
year
old
woman
with
a
history
of
chronic
lung
disease
secondary
to
cystic
fibrosis
cf
developed
an
acute
hemorrhagic
retinopathy
during
exposure
to
moderately
high
altitude
although
retinal
hemorrhages
are
known
to
occur
in
patients
with
cf
we
speculate
that
the
retinopathy
in
this
case
was
partially
related
to
altitudinal
change
and
that
patients
with
chronic
hypoxemia
may
be
predisposed
to
high
altitude
retinopathy
at
much
lower
altitudes
