measurement
of
hydroxyphenylacetic
aciduria
as
a
screening
test
for
small

disease
we
evaluted
measurement
of
urinary
hydroxyphenyl
acetic
acid
as
a
potential
screening
method
for
small
bowel
disease
and
bacterial
overgrowth
syndromes
in
unselected
acutely
ill
infants
and
children
control
data
were
obtained
on
healthy
children
ages
to
years
from
a
general
medical
practice
healthy
infants
ages
one
to
five
years
from
local
day
nurseries
and
healthy
babies
ages
less
than
one
to
eight
days
comparative
data
were
from
acutely
ill
hospitalized
babies
and
children
ranging
in
age
from
less
than
one
day
to
years
and
without
clinical
evidence
for
small
bowel
disease
and
bacterial
overgrowth
syndrome
no
false
negative
results
and
only
false
positive
results
were
observed
among
the
patients
whose
urinary
excretion
of
the
analyte
was
considered
to
be
abnormal
were
patients
with
giardia
lamblia
infestation
ileal
resection
with
blind
loop
and
other
diseases
of
the
small
intestine
associated
with
bacterial
overgrowth
we
conclude
that
measurement
of
hydroxyphenylacetic
acid
excretion
is
useful
in
screening
for
such
diseases
