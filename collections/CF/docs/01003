a
comparative
study
of
inhaled
atropine
sulfate
and
isoproterenol
hydrochloride
in
cystic
fibrosis
to
investigate
the
contribution
of
vagal
tone
to
the
obstructive
airway
disease
in
cystic
fibrosis
we
evaluated
the
pulmonary
function
response
to
administration
of
mg
of
atropine
sulfate
per
kg
of
body
weight
mg
of
isoproterenol
hydrochloride
per
kg
of
body
weight
or
isotonic
saline
control
solution
administered
by
nebulization
on
different
days
to
each
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
in
a
single
blind
study
the
doses
of
atropine
sulfate
and
isoproterenol
hydrochloride
were
based
on
published
dose
response
characteristics
of
the
drugs
each
day
thoracic
gas
volume
and
airway
resistance
were
measured
in
a
volume
displacement
body
plethysmograph
and
maximal
expiratory
flow
volume
curves
were
performed
before
and
at
and
min
after
the
inhalation
after
inhalation
of
saline
group
mean
values
for
all
pulmonary
functions
indicated
greater
airway
obstruction
at
and
min
when
compared
to
pretreatment
values
after
inhalation
of
isoproterenol
and
atropine
significant
improvement
p
was
noted
in
maximal
expiratory
flows
at
per
cent
of
total
lung
capacity
specific
airway
conductance
thoracic
gas
volume
and
residual
volume
inhalation
of
atropine
also
significantly
improved
maximal
expiratory
flow
at
per
cent
of
vital
capacity
isoproterenol
increased
the
mean
flows
by
to
per
cent
above
baseline
and
decreased
thoracic
gas
volume
and
residual
volume
by
to
per
cent
with
the
maximal
response
at
or
min
atropine
increased
mean
flows
by
to
per
cent
and
decreased
thoracic
gas
volume
and
residual
volume
by
to
per
cent
with
the
maximal
effect
at
to
min
the
mean
response
to
atropine
expressed
as
a
percentage
of
baseline
was
always
greater
than
or
equal
to
that
for
isoproterenol
we
conclude
that
vagal
tone
which
may
reflect
increased
irritant
receptor
activity
contributes
to
the
obstructive
pulmonary
function
in
cystic
fibrosis
inhalation
of
atropine
sulfate
will
decrease
the
pulmonary
function
abnormality
but
side
effects
prohibit
its
clinical
usefulness
