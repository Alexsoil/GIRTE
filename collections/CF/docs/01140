arginine
esterase
in
amniotic
fluid
possible
marker
for
cystic
fibrosis
letter
following
rao
and
nadlers
report
of
decrease
arginine
activity
in
the
blood
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
we
have
been
trying
to
apply
their
findings
to
the
prenatal
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
we
were
therefore
most
interested
in
the
reports
on
the
use
of
methylumbelliferyl
rho
guanidinobenzoate
mugb
for
assaying
arginine
esterase
activity
in
amniotic
fluid
our
results
with
mugb
are
similar
to
those
of
brock
and
haywood
but
are
substantially
higher
than
those
of
walsh
and
nedler
a
sample
of
amniotic
fluid
that
had
been
incubated
with
mugb
and
then
assayed
with
pro
phe
arg
methylcoumarinyl
amide
ppa
mca
showed
less
than
of
the
activity
of
a
similarly
treated
control
sample
that
had
not
been
incubated
with
mugb
the
activity
of
arginine
esterase
towards
ppa
mca
both
in
amniotic
fluid
and
in
cultures
amniotic
fluid
cells
is
much
greater
than
towards
cbz
arg
amc
these
levels
of
activity
are
high
enough
to
warrant
further
investigation
for
use
in
an
antenatal
diagnosis
