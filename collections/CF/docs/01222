we
have
shown
that
skin
fibroblast
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
and
from
carriers
for
cf
heterozygotes
hz
consume
more
o
than
do
their
controls
when
the
mitochondrial
electron
transport
inhibitor
rotenone
was
added
to
the
cells
the
relative
inhibition
of
o
consumption
was
cf
greater
than
hz
greater
than
controls
p
less
than
in
both
comparisons
because
rotenone
specifically
inhibits
nadh
dehydrogenase
nadh
acceptor
oxidoreductase
ec
which
is
the
enzyme
of
energy
conserving
site
of
the
mitochondrial
electron
transport
system
activity
and
kinetics
of
this
enzyme
system
were
studied
in
fibroblast
homogenates
nadh
dehydrogenase
activity
was
equal
in
cells
from
the
three
genotypes
at
ph
affinity
of
the
enzyme
for
its
substrate
was
cf
greater

controls
at
ph
affinity
was
cf
greater

hz
controls
p
less
than
for
the
differences
ph
optima
for
the
genotypes
were
without
exception
cf
hz
and
control
hz
and
control
lines
were
distinguished
unequivocally
in
a
blind
test
on
the
basis
of
differences
in
ph
optima
purified
mitochondrial
preparations
revealed
ph
optima
identical
to
those
found
in
whole
cell
homogenates
these
data
suggest
that
the
mutant
gene
responsible
for

expressed
in
the
complex
mitochondrial
nadh

system
