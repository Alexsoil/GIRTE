a
retrospective
study
of
clinical
and
radiological
lung
symptoms
and
intensity

of
patients
with

was
conducted
the

were

fourteen

simple
scoring
systems
for

lung
symptoms
and
for
treatment
of

disease
were
developed
when
compared
at
the
same
ages
class
i
and
iii
patients
were
more
severely
affected
judged
by
the
clinical

than
class

they
had
been
more

comparing

with

it
was
found
that
class

were

had
been
more
intensively

than
class
i
ii
patients
as

judged
by

a
similar
pattern
was
seen
but
no
statistically
significant
differences
were
found
in
patients
of

of
class
ii
and
of
class
iii
the
serum

were
studied
it
was
found
that
class

patients
had
more
severe
alterations
than
class
ii
patients
and
more
than
class
i
ii
patients
the
proportion
of
female
patients
in
class
iii
was
greater
than
in
the
other
two
classes
but
this
could
not
explain
the
differences
because
of
the
small
number
of
patients
in
class
i
the
differences
between
class
i
and
class
ii
patients
are
more
doubtful
than
the
differences
between
class

and
class
ii
patients
or
between

and

ii
patients
