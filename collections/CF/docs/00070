this

describes
investigations
on
the
absorption
of
methoxyphenyl
l
alanine
anisylalanine
in
normal
subjects
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
in
one
child
with
hartnup
disease
anisylalanine
was
slowly
metabolised
mainly
to
acetyl
anisylalanine
and
p
methoxyphenyl
pyruvic
acid
and
lactic
acids
which
were
excreted
in
normal
adult
subjects

maximum

concentrations
being
obtained
hour
after
ingestion
thereafter
the
plasma
concentration
declined
exponentially
in
the
group
of
eight
children
with
cystic

the
maximum
plasma
concentration
was
lower
than
observed
in
the
control
group
and
was
delayed
a
very
poor
response
was
observed
in

infant
with

disorder
