incorporation
of

g
a
g
we
have
found
significant
variation
among
c
f
patients
and
their
parents
obligate
heterozygotes
this
biochemical
heterogeneity
is
comparable
to
what
has
been
reported
in
fibroblast
cultures
and
serum
the

incorporated
into

in
both
the
incubation
medium
and
the
cells
from

is

a

analysis
between
normals
and
heterozygotes
shows
no
significant

in

incorporation

a

however
out
of
heterozygotes
appeared
to
show
a
pattern
of
increased
incorporation
into
material
found
in
the
incubation
medium
indicated
by
a
higher
mean
than
the
normal
donors
these
results
suggest
yet
another
system
to

the
effects

the

additional
evidence

the
genetic

in
