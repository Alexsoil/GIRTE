purified
preparations
of
plasma
alpha
macroglobulin
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
are
shown
to
have
normal
amounts
of
total

but
as
much
as
decrease
in
their
sialic
acid
content
the

of
these
preparations

agglutinin
was
markedly
reduced
as
compared
to
normal
values
in

intermediate

these
results
suggest
a
possible
alteration
in
the

moiety
of

in

presumably
due
to
a
defective

process
