glycosidases
in
serum
of
cystic
fibrosis
patients
in
a
study
of
eight
glycosidases
in
serum
samples
from
cystic
fibrosis
patients
cystic
fibrosis
parents
and
healthy
and
diseased
controls
significant
elevations
of
mean
alpha
glucosidase
levels
were
found
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
all
other
glycosidases
did
not
show
any
significant
change
mean
alpha
glucosidase
levels
in
obligate
heterozygotes
were
the
same
as
in
control
individuals
moreover
alpha
glucosidase
levels
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
correlated
with
the
degree
of
clinical
impairment
as
measured
by
the
schwachman
score
