clinical
aspects
of
mucociliary
transport
it
has
long
been
believed
that
the
mucociliary
apparatus
of
the
airways
serves
to
remove
inhaled
particulate
matter
from
the
tracheobronchial
mucosa
thereby
contributing
to
pulmonary
host
defense
this
review
deals
mainly
with
factors
affecting
mucociliary
transport
that
may
be
of
clinical
importance
the
information
available
at
present
strongly
suggests
that
mucociliary
transport
at
least
in
central
airways
is
impaired
in
most
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
however
it
is
still
unclear
whether
this
disorder
is
a
nonspecific
feature
of
the
chronic
inflammatory
airway
disease
or
represents
an
essential
factor
in
the
pathogenesis
of
the
pulmonary
abnormalities
