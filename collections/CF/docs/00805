chemical
markers

glycoproteins

their
relation
to
viscosity
in
mucoid
and
purulent
sputum
from
various
hypersecretory
diseases
mucus
and
serum
are
always
present
in
sputum
the
concentrations
of
their
markers
were
measured
in
mucoid
and
purulent
sputum
from
patients
with
chronic
bronchitis
asthma
cystic
fibrosis
or
bronchiectasis
differences
in
the
concentrations
of
both
mucous
and
serum
glycoproteins
were
greater
among
different
macroscopic
types
of
sputum
than
among
diseases
for
the
same
macroscopic
type
comparison
between
diseases
showed
that
sputum
from
patients
with
asthma
had
the
widest
variation
in
concentrations
of
markers
of
mucous
glycoprotein
and
dry
macromolecular
weight
when
the
astham
group
was
further
analyzed
it
became
apparent
that
patients
with
extrinsic
asthma
without
chronic
bronchitis
represented
a
homogeneous
group
whereas
those
with
intrinsic
asthma
with
or
without
chronic
bronchitis
were
responsible
for
the
wide
variation
the
concentrations
of
markers
of
mucous
and
serum
glycoproteins
in
a
sputum
sample
were
correlated
with
the
apparent
viscosity
of
the
sputum
to
establish
the
relative
contribution
of
the
glycoproteins
to
the
viscosity
of
sputum
in
mucoid
sputum
the
mucous
glycoprotein
was
most
important
in
determining
the
viscosity
whereas
when
in
infected
sputum
both
mucous
and
serum
components
contributed
to
the
viscosity
