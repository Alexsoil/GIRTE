postprandial
total
serum
bile
acid
concentrations
in
cystic
fibrosis
in
recent
years
several
workers
have
reported
that
a
single
hour
postprandial
total
serum
bile
acid
tsba
concentration
in
a
variety
of
liver
disease
states
is
a
more
sensitive
index
of
deranged
liver
function
than
are
the
conventional
serum
liver
function
tests
this
observation
seemed
to
us
to
provide
a
challenging
situation
for
the
assessment
of
tsba
concentrations
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
distribution
of
results
for
the
cf
patients
mean
tsba
concentration
micromol
l
and
for
the
age
matched
controls
mean
concentration
micromol
l
shows
a
wider
range
for
the
cf
group
statistical
analysis
however
of
these
two
groups
shows
no
significant
difference
between
them
many
factors
affect
both
the
size
and
distribution
of
the
bile
acid
pool
in
cf
and
a
consideration
of
these
factors
may
go
some
way
towards
explaining
the
rather
unspectacular
tsba
results
