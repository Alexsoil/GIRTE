pathology
of
cystic
fibrosis
review
of
the
literature
and
comparison
with
autopsied
cases
this
review
of
pathologic
findings
in
cystic
fibrosis
includes
a
survey
of
morphologic
changes
from
the
original
descriptions
of
cf
and
the
numerous
subsequent
reports
and
an
analysis
of
cases
autopsied
at
the
johns
hopkins
hospital
and
billings
hospital
achylia
occurs
in
to
of
patients
approximately
of
patients
with
cf
presents
with
meconium
ileus
in
we
described
gallbladder
abnormalities
in
of
cases
of
cf
in
anderson
s
original
description
of
cf
hemosiderosis
was
present
in
nearly
every
liver
and
fatty
infiltration
was
a
frequent
finding
the
respiratory
tract
is
invariably
involved
in
cf
the
heart
has
never
been
considered
a
primary
target
organ
in
cf
bodian
described
a
higher
incidence
of
nephrocalcinosis
in
cf
than
in
routine
pediatric
autopsies
compared
to
with
the
increased
longevity
of
patients
with
cf
male
sterility
has
become
a
recognized
complication
increased
electrolyte
concentrations
in
sweat
are
the
most
diagnostic
manifestation
of
cf
although
an
occasional
patient
has
escaped
this
defect
nasal
polyps
are
frequent
and
often
recurrent
problems
in
patients
with
cf
malabsorption
due
to
pancreatic
exocrine
deficiency
was
originally
described
as
the
main
manifestation
of
cf
the
autopsy
diagnosis
of
cf
is
usually
based
on
a
combination
of
lesions
rather
than
on
the
changes
in
a
single
organ
