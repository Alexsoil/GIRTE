structure
and
function
of
small
airways
in
health
and
disease
during
the
last
two
decades
great
strides
have
been
made
in
our
understanding
of
the
functional
aspects
of
airflow
in
the
periphery
of
the
lung
it
seems
that
the
small
airways
are
the
important
site
of
obstruction
in
a
variety
of
chronic
respiratory
disorders
associated
with
airflow
obstruction
this
review
deals
with
the
anatomic
and
functional
aspects
of
small
airways
in
normal
and
diseased
lungs
in
particular
the
basis
of
obstruction
or
narrowing
that
is
not
dependent
on
intrinsic
airway
lesion
is
reviewed
the
variety
of
pathologic
changes
in
small
airways
observed
in
these
diseases
are
outlined
along
with
physiologic
tests
that
are
currently
used
to
detect
dysfunction
at
a
stage
long
before
they
produce
symptoms
or
alter
standard
tests
of
lung
function
