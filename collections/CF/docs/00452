antibiotic
management
of
cystic
fibrosis
cystic
fibrosis
is
the
most
common
autosomal
recessive
disorder
in
great
britain
central
europe
and
north
america
and
it
affects
in
live
born
children
does
the
antibiotic
treatment
in
cystic
fibrosis
differ
from
the
treatment
of
respiratory
infection
in
other
conditions
the
cystic
fibrosis
patient
not
only
suffers
progressive
deterioration
in
respiratory
function
he
often
has
dangerous
complicating
conditions
culminating
in
super
infection
by
highly
resistant
organisms
the
basic
principle
of
antibiotic
therapy
must
be
rigidly
applied
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
first
principle
is
to
identify
the
pathogen
and
its
susceptibility
to
antibiotics
the
second
principle
is
to
ensure
that
the
chosen
antibiotic
reaches
the
site
of
infection
the
third
principle
is
that
the
antibiotic
therapy
ought
to
complement
the
immunological
defences
of
the
patient
a
fourth
principle
is
that
no
therapy
must
be
given
without
first
deciding
upon
the
criteria
which
will
be
acceptable
as
indicating
clinical
improvement
