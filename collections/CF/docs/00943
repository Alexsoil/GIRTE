pathophysiology
of
failure
to
thrive
in
gastrointestinal
disorders
what
will
be
our
gi
approach
to
a
child
with
ftt
syndrome
detailed
history
and
physical
examination
will
give
us
the
clue
and
often
the
probable
diagnosis
several
laboratory
tests
are
helpful
in
establishing
the
fact
that
there
is
malabsorption
among
them
are
a
complete
blood
count
with
smear
quantitative
stool
fat
excretion
serum
protein
and
chemistry
screen
panel
prothrombin
time
and
oral
tolerance
and
absorption
i
e
of
glucose
iron
vitamin
a
and
xylose
specialized
procedures
may
be
used
to
nail
down
the
diagnosis
radiology
biopsy
duodenal
intubation
etc
these
should
never
be
employed
as
routine
screening
tests
however
in
outlining
a
comprehensive
and
successful
therapy
the
attending
physician
will
find
it
helpful
to
consider
the
particular
pathophysiologic
mechanisms
of
a
specific
disease
exact
diagnosis
makes
the
therapy
both
rational
and
effective
