do

diagnose
cystic

the
nauplii
of
the
brine
shrimp
artemia
salina
are
dependent
upon
the
function
of
their
salt
gland
to
maintain
osmotic
pressure
within
narrow
limits
a
number
of
drugs
interfere
with
this
function
and
are
lethal
to
the
nauplii
saliva
and
serum
from
normal
persons
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
obligate
heterozygotes
were
tested
for
lethal
effect
against
brine
shrimp
nauplii
at
salt
concentrations
between
mm
and
no
difference
was
found
among
the
phenotypes
at
lower
concentrations
a
difference
was
noted
occasionally
between
some
normal
subjects
and
some
individuals
carrying
one
or
two
genes
for
cystic
fibrosis
data
from
an
independent
series
of
experiments
indicate
that
the
naupliar
deaths
result
from
distorted
ratios
of
na
k
and
not
from
a
specific
gene
product
no
difference
was
noted
in
the
o
uptake
of
nauplii
treated
with
saliva
or
serum
obtained
from
normal
subjects
patients
with
