acid
soluble
glycoproteins
in
amniotic
fluid
and
cystic
fibrosis
of
the
foetus
we
suggest
that
the
intrauterine
detection
of
cystic
fibrosis
may
be
based
on
the
investigation
of
the
amniotic
fluid
it
is
known
that
the
protein
content
of
the
meconium
of
homozygotic
newborn
infants
is
significantly
increased
whereas
that
of
heterozygotic
infants
is
only
moderately
increased
as
a
result
of
intrauterine
intestinal
activity
the
bowel
content
may
be
excreted
into
the
amniotic
fluid
thus
a
detectable
deviation
in
the
protein
content
of
amniotic
fluid
may
be
expected
we
decided
to
determine
the
total
protein
content
and
the
amount
of
acid
soluble
glycoproteins
in
amniotic
fluid
samples
both
by
polography
and
by
measuring
the
hexose
content
in
the
homozygous
case
a
slight
increase
was
observed
in
total
protein
content
whereas
in
the
heterozygous
cases
no
changes
were
observed
