the
bacteriological
effect
of
chemotherapy
against
mucoid
strains
of
pseudominas
aeruginosa
in
the
lower
respiratory
tract
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
is
reported
a
comparison
of
the
effect
of
high
doses
of
tobramycin
mg
kg
h
given
alone
or
in
combination
with
carbenicillin
showed
a
significant
difference
in
favour
of
the
combination
therapy
in
of
the
initially
successful
courses
the
patients
were
recolonized
within
one
month
fifty
three
patients
were
examined
by
audiometric
and
vestibular
tests
only
in
one
patient
was
it
possible
to
register
a
transient
high
tone
hearing
impairment
at
hz
bilaterally
that
might
be
attributed
to
the
tobramycin
treatment
it
is
concluded
that
high
dose
tobramycin
treatment
in
children
and
adolescents
with
normal
kidney
function
implies
only
a
minimal
clinical
risk
of
adverse
ototoxic
effects
even
after
repeated
courses
of

no
