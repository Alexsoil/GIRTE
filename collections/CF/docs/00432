immunologic
aspects
of
cystic
fibrosis
pp
because
of
the
prominent
role
of
infection
in
cystic
fibrosis
and
because
of
the
genetic
nature
of
both
cystic
fibrosis
and
specific
immune
defects
considerable
effort
has
been
expended
in
determining
if
there
are
hereditary
immune
defects
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
that
render
them
susceptible
to
infection
against
a
congenital
immune
defect
is
the
fact
that
the
infections
nearly
always
are
localized
to
the
lung
with
the
same
two
organisms
rather
than
infections
at
multiple
sites
involving
multiple
organisms
specific
immune
mechanisms
in
the
b
and
t
cell
systems
are
examined
nonspecific
host
defense
mechanisms
include
the
complement
system
phagocytosis
pulmonary
clearance
the
pulmonary
barrier
to
the
systemic
spread
of
infection
protease
inhibitors
and
factor
xiii
dependent
systems
hypersensitivity
states
include
allergy
and
atopy
allergic
aspergillosis
immune
complex
disease
and
hypersensitivity
to
pancreatic
extracts
the
presence
or
absence
of
specific
antigen
components
and
the
association
of
hl
a
antigens
are
also
discussed
