infection
with
the
gram
negative
bacillus
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
is
less
common
than
infections
with
escherichia
coli
klebsiella
pneumoniae
and
proteus
sp
however
the
mortality
associated
with
pseudomonas
sepsis
exceeds
that
found
with
the
more
commonly
isolated
gram
negative
bacilli
by
a
considerable
margin
while
explanations
exist
for
this
increased
virulence
of
pseudomonas
including
secretions
of
toxic
exoproducts
and
a
high
degree
of
antibiotic
resistance
the
precise
reasons
for
such
unfavorable
clinical
experience
with
this
organism
are
uncertain
the
current
interest
in
pseudomonas
infection
is
partly
due
to
the
ever
increasing
numbers
