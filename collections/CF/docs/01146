letter
lysosomal
acid
hydrolases
and
alkaline
phosphatase
cooperate
in
the
intracellular
digestion
of
natural
polymers
a
stimulus
for
the
induction
of
these
enzymes
is
the
retention
of
any
kind
of
polymer
inside
the
cell
this
stimulus
is
long
lasting
and
strong
if
polymers
are
intracellularly
retained
because
of
a
lack
of
digestive
enzymes
in
previous
papers
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
the
alkaline
phosphatase
aip
induction
with
tamm
horsfall
glycoprotein
discriminates
between
fibroblasts
of
cf
homozygotes
on
the
one
hand
and
normals
and
cf
carriers
on
the
other
hand
and
a
hypothesis
has
been
proposed
to
explain
these
observations
as
predicted
more
efficient
inducing
mixtures
have
since
been
developed
these
have
been
used
in
the
present
study
the
first
writer
familiarized
himself
with
ultramicrotechniques
and
then
carried
out
double
blind
studies
on
fibroblast
cultures
from
french
patients
these
findings
demonstrate
the
reproducibility
of
the
aip
induction
and
of
the
methods
used
and
they
particularly
underline
the
importance
of
employing
the
present
ultramicrotechniques
for
a
successful
aip
induction
it
is
likely
that
amniotic
fluid
cells
behave
like
skin
fibroblasts
in
this
test
if
this
proves
to
be
so
then
the
induction
of
alkaline
phosphatase
should
provide
a
useful
technique
for
the
prenatal
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
