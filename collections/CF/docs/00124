number
of
ouabain
binding
sites
in
fibroblasts
from
normal
subjects
and
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
autosomal
recessive
disease
is
a
defect
in
the
net
sodium
transport
in
the
eccrine
glands
resulting
in
an
increased
concentration
of
sodium
in
the
sweat
because
of
possible
complications
in
the
erythrocytes
from
cf
patients
and
since
the
activity
observed
in
a
cell
homogenate
may
not
express
the
situation
in
the
intact
cell
we
have
looked
for
differences
in
the
binding
of
h
ouabain
in
cultured
normal
and
cf
human
diploid
fibroblasts
we
observed
no
appreciable
differences
in
the
number
of
ouabain
binding
sites
between
normal
and
cf
cell
strains
we
were
also
unable
to
observe
any
differences
in
the
kinetics
of
ouabain
binding
between
normal
and
cf
fibroblasts
in
k
free
phosphate
buffered
saline
solution
and
the
results
were
essentially
the
same
as
those
seen
in
hela
cells
we
observed
no
alterations
in
the
kinetics
of
binding
of
ouabain
nor
any
alteration
in
the
total
number
of
binding
sites
