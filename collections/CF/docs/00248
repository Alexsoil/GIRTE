parathenar
palmar
pattern
a
dermatoglyphic
sign
of
possible
clinical
significance
the
frequency
of
a
double
proximal
axial
triradius
dpat
which
results
in
a
palmar
parathenar
pattern
has
been
reported
to
be
increased
in
those
with
ventricular
septal
defect
bsd
we
scored
the
presence
of
this
pattern
in
patients
with
congenital
heart
defects
including
with
isolated
vsd
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
or
relatives
of
those
with
cf
and
with
no
known
clinical
disease
who
were
unrelated
to
individuals
with
cf
the
frequencies
in
these
three
groups
were
and
respectively
none
of
those
with
isolated
vsd
defect
had
a
dpat
all
five
individuals
in
the
heart
defect
group
with
a
dpat
had
pulmonic
stenosis
of
the
total
of
eleven
individuals
in
our
series
with
dpat
patterns
eight
were
affected
only
on
the
right
hand
the
frequency
of
dpat
in
individuals
with
no
known
disease
in
this
series
was
more
than
double
the
frequency
in
a
control
series
published
previously
by
david
if
the
relatives
of
those
with
cf
are
excluded
from
our
own
control
group
the
frequency
of
dpat
in
this
group
is
then
closer
to
the
results
in
david
s
control
series
