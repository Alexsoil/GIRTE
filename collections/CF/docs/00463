in

in
cystic
fibrosis
there
is
chronic
infection
and
inflammatory
reaction
in
the
airways
accompanied
by
destruction
and
shedding
of
airway
epithelium
leukocytes
migrate
into
the
airways
and
some
disintegrate
liberating
deoxyribonucleoprotein
that
is
incorporated
into
the
gel
structure
of
the
bronchial
mucus
we
compared
the
status
of
these
processes
in
cystic
fibrosis
with
that
in
chronic
bronchitis
and
bronchiectasis
by
examining
the
sputum
raised
from
the
lower
airways
measurements
also
were
made
on
sputum
induced
in
normal
subjects
the
results
indicate
that
migration
of
leukocytes
into
the
airways
and
shedding
of
damaged
airway
epithelium
were
minimal
in
the
normal
subjects
they
were
significant
in
the
patients
with
chronic
bronchitis
higher
in
those
with
bronchiectasis
and
still
higher
in
those
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
large
increases
found
in
the
total
content
of
dna
and
solids
in
the
cystic
fibrosis
sputum
were
due
to
increases
in
the
insoluble
fraction
containing
the
whole
leukocytes
and
particulate
debris
that
remained
when
the
sputum
mucus
gel
was
solubilized
with
mercaptoethanol
despite
the
large
increases
in
the
total
content
of
dna
and
solids
the
contents
of
mucus
gel
components
and
of
deoxyribonucleoprotein
from
disintegrated
leukocytes
actually
present
in
the
mucus
gel
structure
of
the
cystic
fibrosis
sputum
were
not
significantly
higher
than
in
the
sputum
from
the
patients
with
chronic
bronchitis
or
brochiectasis
