normal
children
as
well
as
those
with
asthma
and
cystic
fibrosis
were
studied
to
assess
the
contribution
of
lung
zones
emptying
at
different
rates

the
curvilinearity

the
maximal

forced

normal

those

those
with
severe

had
large
transients
as
well
as
increased

i
on

these
large

were
associated
with
increased

smaller

breathing

in

the
large
transients
suggest
sequential
emptying
of
fast
and
slow
spaces
which
influences
the
shape
of
the
maximal
expiratory
flow
volume
curve
the
fast
space
could
be
due
to
compression
of
an
enlarged
anatomic
dead
space
any
time
constant
inequality
between
parenchymal
units
present
in
asthma
and
mild
cystic
fibrosis
does
not
appear
to
contribute
significantly
to
the

of
