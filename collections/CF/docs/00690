prolonged
obstructive
jaundice
and
giant
cell
hepatitis
in
an
infant
with
cystic
fibrosis
letter
histologic
evidence
of
liver
involvement
consisting
of
focal
biliary
cirrhosis
and
or
intrahepatic
mucus
is
a
frequent
autopsy
finding
in
infants
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
we
wish
to
report
an
infant
with
cf
in
which
liver
biopsy
showed
features
typical
of
neonatal
giant
cell
hepatitis
in
our
patient
none
of
the
pathologic
features
usually
described
in
cf
were
present
in
either
of
the
biopsies
rather
the
changes
were
those
described
in
neonatal
hepatitis
and
to
our
knowledge
have
not
been
reported
in
association
with
cf
it
is
likely
that
the
giant
cell
hepatitis
was
a
coincidental
finding
unrelated
to
cf
it
emphasizes
however
that
one
cannot
assume
a
uniform
etiology
for
all
instances
of
obstructive
jaundice
seen
in
infants
with
cf
