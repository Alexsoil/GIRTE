the
success
in
the
isolation
of
staphylococcus
aureus
of
different
methods
of
sputum
processing
was
investigated
in
specimens
collected
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
during
a
seven
month
period
fifty
specimens
from
patients
yielded
staph
aureus
by
one
or
more
methods
direct
plating
of
purulent
portions
of
sputum
on
to
media
designed
for
general
use
in
respiratory
infections
gave
unsatisfactory
results
yield
of
staph
aureus
some
increase
in
isolations
was
obtained
with
preliminary
liquefaction
of
sputum
but
the
best
results
were
given
by
the
addition
of
a
medium
selective
for
staphylococci
mannitol
salt
agar
bbl
or
by
initial
sonication
of
sputum
each
yield
seven
of
the
strains
of
staph
aureus
were
thymidine
dependent
and
otherwise
atypical
in
laboratory
characteristics
these
were
isolated
from
patients
who
had
received
co
trimoxazole
