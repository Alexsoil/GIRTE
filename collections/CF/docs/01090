patterns
from

clinical
isolates
of
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
were
studied
in
an
effort
to
determine
the
unique
characteristics
of
the
infecting
strains
and
to
elucidate
the
pattern
of
colonization
of
patients
studied
were
chronically
infected
with
p
aeruginosa
patients
from
whom
p
aeruginosa
was
never
or
only
occasionally
isolated
were
in
better
clinical
condition
than
the
chronically
infected
patients
isolates
were
classified
into
six
morphologic
varieties
classic
rough
mucoid
gelatinous
dwarf
and
enterobacter
most
patients
had
two
or
more
of
these
varieties
such
multiple
varieties
from
the
same
individual
were
of
the
same
serotype
but
often
differed
in
antibiotic
susceptibility
as
determined
by
both
the
disk
and
the
minimal
inhibitory
concentration
methods
these
differences
were
apparent
when
mucoid
strains
were
compared
with
nonmucoid
strains
and
when
nonmucoid
strains
were
compared
with
one
another
studies
of
antibiotic
susceptibility
should
be
performed
on
each
morphologically
different
type
of
p
aeruginosa
obtained
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
