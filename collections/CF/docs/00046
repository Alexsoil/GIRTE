hereditary
disorders
of
intestinal
transport
hereditary
abnormalities
of
intestinal
transport
are
rare
conditions
but
are
of
disproportionate
importance
because
of
the
information
they
give
regarding
the
mechanisms
of
intestinal
absorption
in
man
the
main
disability
is
usually
diarrhoea
but
there
may
be
abnormalities
from
lack
of
absorption
of
an
essential
nutrient
or
occasionally
from
absorption
of
compounds
in
excess
due
to
failure
of
a
normal
control
mechanism
these
diseases
are
experiments
of
nature
which
cannot
be
exactly
simulated
in
the
laboratory
animal
and
thus
may
on
occasions
give
information
unobtainable
from
other
sources
most
often
however
they
confirm
that
the
mechanisms
of
absorption
studied
in
detail
in
smaller
mammals
are
probably
applicable
to
man
in
some
of
these
diseases
there
is
an
associated
defect
of
transport
in
the
proximal
renal
tubules
as
well
as
in
the
gut
they
furnish
evidence
therefore
that
transport
processes
are
closely
related
in
the
gut
and
in
the
kidney
or
at
least
that
an
important
step
in
transport
is
identical
at
the
two
sites
such
disorders
include
disorders
of
carbohydrate
absorption
hereditary
defects
of
amino
acid
absorption
hereditary
defects
in
the
absorption
of
fat
hereditary
disorders
of
the
intestinal
absorption
of
electrolytes
and
hereditary
defects
of
vitamin
b
absorption
