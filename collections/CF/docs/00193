open
thoracotomy
for
pneumothorax
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
results
of
open
thoractomy
and
pleurectomy
or
pleural
abrasion
for
episodes
of
pneumothorax
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
were
compared
with
the
results
of
observation
closed
thoracostomy
and
closed
thoracostomy
with
sclerosing
agents
open
thoracotomy
had
the
advantage
of
insuring
prompt
resolution
of
the
pneumothorax
a
small
incision
minimized
postoperative
morbidity
the
average
hospital
stay
was
days
after
open
thoracotomy
and
days
after
closed
thoracostomy
with
or
without
sclerosing
agents
complications
of
all
treatments
were
infrequent
a
limited
symptomatic
recurrence
was
observed
in
of
pneumothoraces
successfully
treated
with
open
thoracotomy
recurrence
also
occurred
in
of
treated
with
observation
of
treated
with
closed
thoracostomy
and
of
treated
with
closed
thoracostomy
and
sclerosing
agents
a
loss
of
vital
capacity
was
usually
noted
to
months
after
resolution
regardless
of
treatment
forty
per
cent
of
patients
in
both
operative
and
nonoperative
groups
survived
years
in
our
experience
open
thoracotomy
can
be
used
safely
for
treatment
of
unresolved
or
recurrent
pneumothorax
and
warrants
further
evaluation
as
a
primary
therapy
for
pneumothorax
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
