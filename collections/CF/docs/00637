errors
associated
with
the
in

sweat
test
using
chloride
ion
selective
electrodes
the
in
situ
sweat
test
is
prone
to
errors
from
various
sources
this
paper
examines
errors
due
to
evaporation
absorption
of
water
into
the
skin
and
pressure
of
the
electrode
on
the
skin
only
evaporation
caused
serious
errors
the
accuracy
and
precision
when
measuring
small
chloride
sweat
samples
on
the
skin
are
not
significantly
worse
than
when
measuring
bulk
solutions
