a
retrospective
analysis
of
oral
d
xylose
tolerance
tests
in
pediatric
patients
was
performed
a
significant
difference
was
found
between
normal
subjects
and
untreated
children
with
celiac
disease
one
hour
after
load
the
one
hour
value
was
found
to
be
more
reliable
than
was
fecal

analysis
in

children
for
celiac

surface
did

the
results
of
the
one

value
in
the
control
subjects
forty
eight
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
had
one
hour
xylose
levels
within
the
normal
range
but
the
means
at
and
minutes
after
load
exceeded
significantly
p
less
than
those
of
the
controls
in
a
nonceliac
group
of
children
with
abnormally
low
xylose
levels
almost
all
were
found
to
have
clinical
conditions
compatible
with
upper
small
bowel
mucosal
impairment
this
study
shows
that
a
single
estimation
of
xylose
in
blood
one
hour
after
load
is
a
reliable
index
of
small
bowel
mucosal
function
it
is
a
good
screening
test
for
celiac
disease
and
small

disorders
producing
malabsorption
in
children
