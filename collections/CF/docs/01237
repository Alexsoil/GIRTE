small
airways
disease
in
children
no
test
is
best
tests
claimed
to
detect
small
airway
disease
were
evaluated
in
children
fifty
two
subjects
who
were
normal
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
and
with
asthma
were
selected
on
the
basis
of
normal
spirometry
informed
consent
being
obtained
from
them
and
their
parents
tests
undertaken
were
measurement
of
maximum
expiratory
flow
volume
curves
breathing
air
and
a
helium
oxygen
mixture
single
breath
nitrogen
washout
curves
lung
volumes
and
except
in
the
normal
subjects
measurement
of
arterial
oxygen
tension
closing
volumes
were
normal
in
most
children
with
cf
and
asthma
whereas
the
slope
of
the
alveolar
plateau
was
abnormal
in
maximum
expiratory
flow
rate
at
of
total
lung
capacity
was
reduced
in
and
maximum
mid
expiratory
flow
rate
in
residual
volume
increased
in
and
results
of
other
tests
were
abnormal
in
less
than
of
the
children
there
was
evidence
suggesting
that
lung
disease
was
more
patchy
in
children
with
mild
cf
than
in
those
with
interval
phase
asthma
these
tests
do
not
detect
specific
pathological
processes
in
small
airways
but
reflect
the
consequences
of
small
airway
abnormalities
which
may
vary
in
the
same
disease
as
well
as
in
different
diseases
no
one
test
alone
appears
most
useful
together
they
contribute
to
understanding
the
functional
abnormalities
present
in
each
individual
