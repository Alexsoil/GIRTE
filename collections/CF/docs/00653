correlation

pulmonary

tests
and
echocardiogram
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
vectorcardiogram
vcg
was
correlated
with
various
indices
of
the
severity
of
the
disease
the
best
correlation
was
found
between
the
azimuth
angle
of
the
spatial
qrs
loop
area
representing
the
rightward
and
posterior
shift
of
the
main
electrical
forces
and
pulmonary

tests
pft

r

vcg
parameters
correlated

with

with
the
echocardiogram
this
shows
the
major
influence
of
pulmonary
changes
on
the
vcg
of
those
patients
in
several
subgroups
with
different
clinical
scores
the
vcg
were
analyzed
and
compared
to
normal
limits
of
age
and
sex
matched
controls
in
this
small
series
the
vcg
was
a
specific
but
not
very
sensitive
method
for
predicting
the
degree
of
severity
of
the
disease
echocardiography
and
vectorcardiography
can
be
considered
as
two
complementary
techniques
in
the
evaluation
of
cystic
fibrosis
