immune
complexes
in
cystic
fibrosis
eleven
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
chronically
infected
with
mucoid
p
aeruginosa
and
ten
patients
without
p
aeruginosa
infection
were
examined
for
occurrence
of
circulating
immune
complexes
for
immune
complex
deposits
in
the
dermo
epidermal
junction
of
the
skin
and
for
precipitins
against
p
aeruginosa
s
aureus
h
influenzae
and
d
pneumoniae
antigens
the
serum
concentrations
of
haptoglobin
orosomucoid
immunoglobulins
c

c
c
and
total
haemolytic
complement
antinuclear
and
rheumatoid
factor
activities
as
well
as
white
blood
cell
counts
and
erythrocyte
sedimentation
rates
were
determined
also
the
results
indicated
that
patients
from
the
chronically
p
aeruginosa
infected
group
exhibiting
a
spectrum
of
serum
precipitins
against
p
aeruginosa
antigens
also
had
immune
complexes
in
the
serum
while
only
one
patient
suffering
from
selective
iga
deficiency
in
the
group
without
p
aeruginosa
infection
was
positive
for
soluble
immune
complexes
granular
deposits
of
igm
was
found
in
the
skin
of
of
the
chronically
p
aeruginosa
infected
patients
and
in
of
the
patients
without
p
aeruginosa
infection
a
few
pactients
in
both
groups
had
dermo
epidermal
deposits
of
c
q
c
or
fibrinogen
as
well
eight
of
the
patients
in
the
chronically
infected
group
and
five
in
the
group
without
p
aeruginosa
infection
had
organ
non
specific
antinuclear
factors
the
haptoglobin
levels
appeared
to
be
elevated
in
the
chronically
infected
patients
p
less
than
none
of
the
other
parameters
showed
any
significant
difference
between
the
two
groups
