rates
and
calcium
concentrations
of
sweat
in
relation
to
cystic
fibrosis
the
authors
of
the
recent
article
which
failed
to
show
a
significant
difference
between
sweat
calcium
concentrations
of
cf
patients
and
control
subjects
suggest
that
the
findings
refute
our
hyperpermeability
hypothesis
they
found
sweat
ca
of
to
meq
liter
in
control
subjects
and
to
meq
liter
in
cf
patients
with
these
tremendous
ranges
many
more
subjects
would
be
required
to
prove
or
disprove
a
difference
a
difference
undetectable
in
a
moderate
number
of
subjects
is
probably
not
of
pathophysiologic
significance
if
the
ca
really
varies
unpredictably
sweat
ca
however
is
generally
believed
to
vary
with
the
rate
of
sweating
being
much
higher
at
lower
rates
and
measurements
made
at
comparable
rates
might
well
show
significant
differences
the
authors
did
attempt
to
control
rate
but
in
a
very
inappropriate
manner
they
measured
no
constant
rate
but
took
the
average
rate
during
the
minutes
immediately
after
iontophoresis
this
gives
little
information
concerning
the
rate
at
which
the
sweat
was
actually
produced
