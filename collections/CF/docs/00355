in
children
with
cystic

cf
the
isoenzymes
of
alkaline
phosphatase
ap
were
determined
microelectrophoretically
in
polyacrylamide
and
starch
gel
the
study
was
done
to
evaluate
the
clinical
significance
of
these
additional
data
for
the
diagnosis
of

the
results
lead
to
the
following
conclusions
serum
activity
of
total
ap
is
comparatively
unsensitive
masking
alterations
in
the
isoenzyme
pattern
contributing
to
the
ap
serum
activity
in

resp
bile
