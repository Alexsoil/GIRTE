cystic
fibrosis
in
adults
cases
and
a
review
of
cases
in
the
literature
cystic
fibrosis
is
now
the
most
common
cause
of
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
copd
and
of
pancreatic
insufficiency
in
the
first
three
decades
of
life
in
the
united
states
in
this
report
we
describe
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
aged
to
years
and
review
another
cases
reported
in
the
literature
all
of
these
patients
had
elevated
sweat
chloride
and
sodium
levels
which
proved
excellent
discriminants
for
cystic
fibrosis
even
in
patients
in
the
older
age
group
copd
present
in
per
cent
was
the
major
cause
of
morbidity
and
mortality
and
differed
from
copd
of
other
etiologies
the
progressive
downhill
course
in
these
patients
was
punctuated
by
recurrent
symptomatic
exacerbations
of
chronic
bacterial
bronchitis
caused
by
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
and
staphyloccocus
aureus
and
terminated
in
pulmonary
insufficiency
cor
pulmonale
and
death
copd
was
complicated
by
minor
hemoptysis
in
per
cent
massive
hemoptysis
in
per
cent
and
pneumothorax
in
per
cent
problems
rare
in
children
sinusitis
was
present
in
all
those
examined
roentgenographically
and
per
cent
had
nasal
polyposis
pancreatic
insufficiency
was
present
in
per
cent
of
the
patients
but
in
contrast
to
younger
patients
it
was
seldom
symptomatic
although
steatorrhea
and
azotorrhea
were
still
massive
intussusception
and
meconium
ileus
equivalent
fecal
accumulation
are
frequent
in
adults
per
cent
but
rare
in
children
and
they
require
immediate
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
intervention
with
enemas
of
diatrizoate
sodium
glycosuria
biliary
cirrhosis
cholelithiasis
and
aspermia
were
among
other
complications
height
and
weight
were
usually
within
the
lower
limits
of
normal
but
per
cent
of
the
men
were
above
cm
in
height
and
per
cent
were
overweight
therefore
a
high
index
of
suspicion
is
needed
to
make
the
diagnosis
because
older
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
may
look
quite
well
