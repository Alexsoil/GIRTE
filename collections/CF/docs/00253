comparison
between

route
the
endotracheal
instillation
and
aerosolization
the
levels
of
gentamicin
in
blood
and
in
secretions
of
the
tracheobronchial
tree
were
measured
in
children
with
cystic

and
with
tracheostomy
in
a
cross
over
fashion
after
the
administration
of
mg
of
gentamicin
by
aerosol
or
by
endotracheal
injection
high
levels
of
gentamicin
greater
than
mug
ml
within
the
bronchial
secretions
were
observed
in
children
after
aerosolization
and
in
children
after
endotracheal
instillation
corresponding
blood
levels
were
low
less

in

no

were
found
in

in

no
significant
differences
were
observed
between
children

those
with

since
intramuscular

gentamicin
within

less

in

it
is
concluded
that
the
administration
of
an
antibiotic
such
as
gentamicin
directly
to
the
trachea
by
endotracheal
injection
or
by
aerosolization
might
prove
to
be
