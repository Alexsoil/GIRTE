we
studied
the
clinical

laboratory
characteristics
of
seven
patients
with
sweat
chloride
concentration
consistently
between

meq
liter
each
has
chronic

all
lack

symptoms
laboratory
findings
indicate
the
preservation
of
exocrine

the
patients
include
two

five
children
in
one
family

two
of
four
in
another
in

one

results

the
data
suggest

for

these

may
