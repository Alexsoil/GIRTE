atypical
cystic
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
with
normal
levels
of
sweat
chloride
and
minimal
pancreatic
lesions
this
paper
presents
additional
evidence
of
the
variability
and
independence
of
the
involvement
of
the
sweat
glands
in
cystic
fibrosis
a
case
report
of
an
infant
girl
who
died
at
age
years
of
progressive
pulmonary
disease
is
presented
the
case
indicates
that
fatal
cystic
fibrosis
or
a
variant
thereof
can
exist
with
normal
levels
of
sweat
chloride
and
that
the
pulmonary
disease
develops
independently
of
the
functional
abnormality
of
the
sweat
glands
