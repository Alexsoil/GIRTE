carriers
of

as

plasma
purification
of
the
protein
with

the

migrated
as

on

displayed

on

against
polyvalent

results
from
various
techniques
used
in
its
characterization
indicate
that
this
protein
is
a
fragment
of
alpha
macroglobulin
alpha

which
is
derived
from
alpha

by
proteolytic

quantitation
of

in

treated

that
both
the

inhibited

were
decreased
in
most

relative
to

the
results
of
this
study
indicate
that
plasma
samples
from
cf
homozygotes
and
obligate
heterozygote
carriers
for
cf
show
deficient
proteolytic
cleavage
of
alpha
m
as
compared
with
normal
control
plasma
and
suggest
that
a
structural
abnormality
in
alpha
m
or
a
deficiency
in

proteolytic
activity
may
be
responsible
for
this
deficiency
in
proteolysis
