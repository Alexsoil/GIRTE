sweat
tests
letter
i
agree
that
sweat
tests
are
frequently
not
performed
reliably
but
i
wonder
why
the
clinical
chemist
has
been
singled
out
as
being
responsible
when
most
hospital
laboratories
are
still
directed
by
pathologists
and
not
by
professional
clinical
chemists
in
addition
to
our
laboratory
i
know
of
many
other
hospital
clinical
chemistry
laboratories
in
which
the
test
is
being
performed
properly
furthermore
the
pediatric
committee
of
the
american
association
for
clinical
chemistry
is
working
on
a
review
article
for
the
journal
clinical
chemistry
regarding
the
correct
way
the
sweat
test
should
be
run
clearly
clinical
chemists
do
not
lack
interest
