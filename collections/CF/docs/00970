serum
lipoprotein
concentrations
in
cystic
fibrosis
two
major
classes
of
lipoproteins
low
density
and
high
density
are
decreased
in
the
serum
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
major
apoproteins
are
also
decreased
since
essential
fatty
acids
and
certain
fat
soluble
vitamins
depend
on
lipoproteins
for
transport
in
the
serum
knowledge
of
lipoprotein
levels
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
could
prove
valuable
in
understanding
i
the
basis
for
the
abnormally
low
serum
levels
of
these
fatty
acids
and
vitamins
and
ii
the
effects
of
therapies
involving
these
molecules
