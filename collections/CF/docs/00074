the
cytoplasmic
metachromasia
phenomenon
with
toluidine
blue
in
cultured
skin
fibroblasts
was
studied
in
parents
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
in
controls
positive
findings
were
recorded
in
of
the
cf
parents
and
in
one
of
the
controls
the
average
culture
time
required
for
development
of
maximum
metachromasia
in
positive
cases
was
six
weeks
the
possible
significance
of
the
ametachromatic
cf
patients
in
relation
to
the
suggested
genetic
heterogeneity
of
cystic

is
discussed
