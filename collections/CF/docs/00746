electrophoretic
analysis
of
serum
proteins
in
cystic
fibrosis
this
study
utilized
isoelectric
focusing
and
electrophoresis
in
an
attempt
to
detect
a
cystic
fibrosis
cf
serum
factor
s
for
which
there
is
considerable
indirect
evidence
the
method
of
isoelectric
focusing
in
polyacrylamide
gels
iefag
specified
by
wilson
et
al
as
reproduced
in
our
laboratory
did
not
enable
the
detection
of
a
cf
factor
protein
reported
to
focus
near
ph
consequently
we
employed
our
modified
iefag
techniques
which
enabled
us
to
demonstrate
significantly
enhanced
resolution
and
striking
heterogeneity
in
serum
gamm
globulins
despite
the
significant
increase
in
the
number
of
bands
resolved
by
our
methods
neither
a
difference
at
ph
nor
other
differences
throughout
the
alkaline
ph
range
could
be
detected
consistently
in
the
cf
and
heterozygous
sera
the
two
step
iefag
disc
electrophoresis
technique
outline
by
altland
et
al
as
reproduced
in
our
laboratory
indicated
that
at
least
one
small
cationic
protein
could
be
fractioned
from
all
serum
samples
improvements
in
the
method
of
disc
electrophoresis
resulted
in
the
observation
of
numerous
bands
from
some
samples
and
of
differences
among
the
samples
but
no
protein
band
unique
to
the
cf
genotypes
was
observed
our
approach
employing
different
electrophoresis
techniques
and
varying
the
conditions
of
sample
analysis
should
have
increased
the
likelihood
of
detecting
a
protein
or
proteins
specific
for
the
cf
genotypes
despite
the
many
variations
in
our
approach
no
consistently
unique
protein
was
observed
in
the
cf
or
heterozygous
sera
a
cf
serum
factor
cannot
be
readily
demonstrated
by
the
electrophoretic
techniques
described
the
value
of
the
biophysical
assay
and
the
nonbiologic
technique
reported
in
the
literature
is
suspect
and
the
promise
and
applicability
of
these
techniques
as
diagnostic
tests
for
the
cf
gene
should
be
carefully
evaluated
