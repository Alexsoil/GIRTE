of

and
the

variants
in
vitro
mucoid
strains
of
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
isolated
from
the
sputa
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
or
in
vitro
through
selection
with
phage
were
more
resistant
to
carbenicillin
flucloxacillin
and
tobramycin
and
more
sensitive
to
tetracycline
than
related
non
mucoid
strains
the
observations
led
to
the
development
of
a
technique
for
the
isolation
of
mucoid

in

based
on
enhanced

mucoid

were
isolated
from

found
to
be
similar

that
obtained
from
