serotonin
metabolism
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
average
blood
serotonin
level
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
was
found
to
be
about
twice
that
of
age
matched
normal
children
there
was
no
corresponding
increase
in
the
urinary
excretion
of
hydroxyindoleacetic
acid
hiaa
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
were
well
able
to
metabolize
serotonin
taken
by
mouth
no
significant
correlations
were
found
between
the
blood
serotonin
level
and
the
platelet

test
out
of
patients
had
raised
serum
ige
levels
and
their
mean
blood
serotonin
was
higher
than
in
those
with
normal
ige
levels
no
explanation
for
this
emerged
comparable
findings
raised

normal

have
been
reported
only
in
severe
mental
retardation
further
study
of
this
phenomenon
is
warranted
because
a
a
raised
blood
serotonin
level
is
sufficiently
characteristic
of
cystic
fibrosis
to
explore
its
use
in
diagnosis
and
b
it
may
help
to
explain
the
pathogenesis
of
cystic

and
c
the
metabolism
and

of
serotonin
