assessment
of
cor
pulmonale
in
cystic
fibrosis
by
echocardiography
thirty
one
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
of
varying
severity
were
examined
by
echocardiography
right
ventricular
dimension
rvd
was
above
upper
normal
limit
in
patients
and
right
ventricular
dimension
index
rvd
index
was
higher
than
the
upper
normal
limit
in
patients
furthermore
there
was
a
significant
relationship
between
increasing
rvd
index
and
decreasing
forced
vital
capacity
fvc
both
actual
test
results
and
average
months
values
and
decreasing
peak
expiratory
flow
rate
pefr
both
actual
test
results
and
average
months
values
this
observation
suggests
a
persistent
heart
involvement
five
patients
had
either
heart
failure
and
or
electrocardiographic
evidence
of
right
ventricular
abnormality
these
patients
had
increased
rvd
index
and
one
patient
with
the
highest
rvd
index
died
weeks
after
the
examination
the
present
study
has
shown
the
usefulness
of
echocardiographic
measurement
of
right
ventricular
dimension
and
of
septal
motion
in
assessing
cor
pulmonale
before
development
of
electrocardiographic
abnormalities
and
right
heart
failure
