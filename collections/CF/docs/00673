dental
aspects
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
a
preliminary
clinical
study
the
oral
conditions
of
patients
being
treated
for
cystic
fibrosis
were
evaluated
the
patients
were
grouped
by
age
and
in
some
aspects
were
compared
with
a
small
control
group
of
their
siblings
the
patient
group
had
a
lowered
incidence
of
plaque
and
less
gingival
disease
than
did
the
control
group
in
which
every
person
had
some
amount
of
plaque
or
gingival
disease
calculus
formation
was
minimal
the
reasons
for
the
finding
of
minimal
plaque
in
the
patient
group
could
be
related
to
several
factors
including
the
life
long
use
of
various
antibiotic
agents
the
chewing
of
digestive
enzyme
supplements
the
effect
of
medical
management
on
tooth
hardness
and
the
effect
of
stained
teeth
possible
tetracycline
deposition
on
the
plaque
microorganisms
it
appears
that
the
therapy
for
cystic
fibrosis
was
beneficial
to
the
periodontal
health
of
these
patients
much
further
study
is
needed
to
understand
the
interrelationship
between
an
altered
oral
environment
salivary
changes
in
cystic
fibrosis
altered
microbial
flora
by
antibiotics
enzymes
and
even
altered
tooth
surfaces
possible
tetracycline
deposition
most
patients
were
found
to
have
one
or
more
oral
habits
tooth
mobility
was
associated
with
tension
habits
patients
who
had
clubbed
fingers
indicating
pulmonary
compromise
and
possibly
a
severe
disease
process
did
not
appear
to
have
either
stained
teeth
or
the
severity
of
the
gingivitis
associated
with
this
the
relationship
of
tetracycline
to
tooth
staining
could
not
be
pinpointed
