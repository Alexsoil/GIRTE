marker
for
detecting
heterozygote
carriers
significance
in
relation
to
future
screening
and
to
a
proposed
primary
defect
in
alpha
macroglobulin
the
fact
that
alpha
macroglobulin
and
cystic
fibrosis
cda
are
made
by
fibroblasts
and
monocytes
points
to
the
fact
that
these
markers
and
the
cf
protein
will
be
of
value
for
the
detection
of
the
cf
gene
antenatally
screening
for
cfp
and
cf
cda
by
isoelectric
focusing
or
radioimmunoassay
in
conjunction
with
quantitation
of
the
functional
capacity
of
a
m

homozygous
from

gene
