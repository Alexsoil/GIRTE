morphological

histological
changes
observed
in
the
large
intestinal
mucosa
of
cystic
fibrosis
cf
patients
including
crypt
enlargement
as
well
as
intracellular
and
extracellular
accumulation
of
mucus
have
been
considered
by
some
to
be
useful
diagnostic
signs
of
this
disease
the
extent
of
these
changes
however
has
not
been
evaluated
quantitatively
in
this
study
quantitative
stereological
methods
were
applied
to
biopsies
of
rectal
mucosa
from
cf
patients
sibling
controls
and
normal
adults
to
measure
goblet
cell
numbers
crypt
luminal
volume
and
volume
of
intracellular
mucus
it
was
found
that
cf
crypt
lumina
were
variably
dilated
but
that
the
average
relative
volume
of
intracellular
mucus
and
the
numbers
of
goblet
cells
in
cf
mucosae
were
comparable
to
those
of
sibling
and
adult
controls
in
cf
biopsies
however
surface
columnar
absorptive
cells
consistently
contained
putative
lipid
droplets
and
rapidly
accumulated
additional
large
lipid
droplets
during
short
term
organ
culture
lipid
droplets
were
not
observed
in
the
same

of
