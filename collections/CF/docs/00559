cystic
fibrosis
cf
is
a
recessive
autosomal
genetic
disease
in
which
exocrine
glands
secrete
highly
viscous
mucus
variable
genetic
penetrance
organ
sparing
results
in
a
broad
spectrum
of
clinical
presentations
the
diagnosis
of
cf
is
usually
established
by
the
presence
of
chronic
obstructive
lung
disease
and
or
gastrointestinal
dysfunction
together
with
elevated
levels
of
sweat
electrolytes
chloride
meq
liter
markedly
diminished
duodenal
pancreatic
enzyme
concentrations
or
pathologic
changes
in
tissue
family
history
may
occasionally
be
helpful
the
metabolic
basis
of
cf
is
unknown
the
classic
stereotype
of
the
cf
patient
is
an
infant
with
a
chronic
cough
diarrhea
and
growth
failure
improved
medical
care
is
enabling
many
of
these
patients
to
reach
adulthood
and
increased
diagnostic
suspicion
is
resulting
in
identification
of
the
disease
in
more
adults
based
upon
analysis
of
over
cases
of
cf
reported
during
the
year
by
cystic
fibrosis
centers
the
national
cystic
fibrosis
foundation
estimated
that
the
probability
of
an
individual
with
cf
surviving
to
age
was
approximately
although
most
of
these
adults
are
currently
under
the
care
of
pediatricians
the
development
of
medical
psychiatric
surgical
or
obstetric
complications
may
necessitate
the
involvement
of
other
professionals
a
joint
study
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
adults
conducted
by
duke
medical
center
and
the
nih
has
shown
that
the
majority
of
affected
adults
including
those
diagnosed
early
in
life
are
married
and
work
full
or
part
time
many
manifest
few
if
any
symptoms
until
relatively
late
in
life
since
this
study
was
retrospective
the
reported
frequencies
of
the
clinical
findings
tend
to
underestimate
in
all
instances
the
actual
incidence
in
the
population
studied
the
reported
incidence
of
cf
in
the
united
states
has
been
conservatively
estimated
at
live
births
if
all
adults
with
clubbing
infertility
and
other
symptoms
were
evaluated
for
cf
the
true
incidence
would
certainly
be
higher
