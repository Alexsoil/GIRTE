screening
for
the
early
detection
of
diseases
in
great
britain
an
account
is
given
of
screening
for
the
early
detection
of
disease
in
great
britain
today
the
organisation
of
screening
programmes
provided
nationally
for
the
whole
population
is
described
these
include
programmes
for
prenatal
care
screening
of
infants
screening
of
schoolchildren
and
screening
of
women
for
carcinoma
in
situ
of
the
uterine
cervix
selective
screening
programmes
for
tuberculosis
and
for
various
industrial
diseases
are
mentioned
experience
in
provision
of
these
services
on
a
national
scale
has
emphasised
the
importance
of
evaluating
future
screening
programmes
before
they
are
implemented
by
research
studies
on
their
effectiveness
their
possibly
harmful
side
effects
and
their
cost
evidence
from
research
in
screening
for
a
number
of
diseases
is
very
briefly
summarized
and
it
is
concluded
that
there
may
be
some
development
of
programmes
for
the
early
detection
and
treatment
of
hypertension
and
of
breast
cancer
but
for
other
diseases
and
for
multiphasic
screening
evidence
so
far
available
is
insufficient
to
warrant
any
immediate
extension
from
research
towards
service
