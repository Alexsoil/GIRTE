forty
five
patients
male

female
over

been
studied
clinically
radiologically
and
physiologically
their
mean
age
at
the
first
visit
was
years
they
were
followed
for
a
mean
period
of
years
and
attended
at
least
every

of
the
patients
was
respiratory
thirty
two
of
the
patients
had
severe
lung
disease

universal
had
haemoptyses
and
eight
pneumothoraces
staphylococcus
pyogenes
haemophilus

and
the
increasing
prevalence
of
the
latter
was
again
confirmed
acquisition
of
the
mucoid
strain
of
pseudomonas
signified
poor
prognosis
established
infection
was
never
eradicated

influence
of
cystic
fibrosis
on
growth
and

is
reported
the
growth
spurt
is
late
in
the
majority
but
growth
failure
is
not
confined
to
those

infection
or
malabsorption
and
in
these
