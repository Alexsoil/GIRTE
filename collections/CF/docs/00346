serum
of

cystic
fibrosis
sera
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
patients
with
other
respiratory
diseases
and
control
persons
have
been
investigated
for
the
occurrence
of
antibacterial
precipitins
and
autoantibodies
preciptins
were
studied
by
means
of
crossed
immunoelectrophoresis
antinuclear
factors
by
an
indirect
immunofluorescence
technique
and
rheumatoid
factors
by
the
latex
fixation
slide
test
a
very
heterogeneous
antibacterial
immune
response
was
found
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
notably
as
regards
ps
aeruginosa
none
of
the
other
patients
or
controls
had
precipitins
against
this
bacterium
the
occurrence
of
precipitins
against
st
aureus
and
d
pneumoniae
were
more
frequent
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
as
compared
with
controls
but
not
as
compared
with
other
respiratory
disease
patients
no
significant
differences
were
found
as
regards
precipitins
against
h
influenzae
or
the
occurrence
of
rheumatoid
factors
antinuclear
factors
were
more
frequent
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
than
in
the
other
two
groups
investigated
a
pronounced
and
heterogeneous
humoral
immune
response
against
ps
aeruginosa
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
chronically
infected
with
mucoid
strains
of
this
bacterium
was
found
to
be
correlated
with
poor
prognosis
and
the
reason
for
this
is
discussed
