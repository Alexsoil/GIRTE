treatment
of
pseudomonas
infections
in
cystic
fibrosis
using
tobramycin
it
was
decided
to
treat
all
seventeen
cystic
fibrosis
patients
under
our
care
who
were
known
to
have
active
infection
with
mucoid
strains
of
pseudomonas
using
large
intravenous
doses
of
tobramycin
by
the
objective
observations
made
results
were
not
so
satisfactory
changes
in
white
blood
cell
count
and
erythrocyte
sedimentation
rate
seemed
often
to
conflict
with
clinical
impression
of
improvement
however
there
was
closer
agreement
between
subjective
judgements
weight
gain
and
respiratory
function
changes
eradication
of
pseudomonas
from
the
sputum
was
achieved
in
four
cases
although
the
duration
of
follow
up
in
one
was
very
short
