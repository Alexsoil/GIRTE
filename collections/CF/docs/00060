differential
diagnosis
of
childhood
asthma
asthma
according
to
the
united
states
national
tuberculosis
association
is
a
disease
characterized
by
an
increased
responsiveness
of
the
trachea
and
bronchi
to
various
stimuli
and
made
manifest
by
difficulty
of
breathing
due
to
generalized
narrowing
of
the
airways
this
narrowing
is
dynamic
and
changes
in
degree
either
spontaneously
or
because
of
therapy
the
basic
defect
appears
to
be
an
altered
state
of
the
host
the
maxim
all
that
wheezes
is
not
asthma
justifiably
reinforces
the
importance
of
differential
diagnosis
indeed
the
characteristic
features
of
asthma
may
be
found
to
some
degree
in
a
wide
variety
of
chest
conditions
or
general
systemic
diseases
the
purposes
of
this
monograph
are
to
review
those
conditions
that
may
be
confused
with
asthma
and
to
focus
attention
on
the
specific
points
of
importance
in
the
history
physical
examination
and
laboratory
test
results
that
might
provide
clues
to
the
final
diagnosis
