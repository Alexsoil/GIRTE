letter
we
examined
the
age
dependence
of
serum
angiotensin
converting
enzyme
sace
activity
in
healthy
controls
while
we
found
no
age
dependence
in
controls
older
than
years
those
under
had
much
increased
sace
values
we
feel
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
evaluate
sace
activity
in
patients
under
years
old
with
diagnostic
criteria
determined
in
adults
dr
romer
and
colleagues
reported
high
activities
of
sace
in
patients
out
of
with
chronic
granulomatous
disease
cgd
and
concluded
that
cgd
is
associated
with
increased
levels
of
sace
unfortunately
romer
et
al
did
not
study
an
adequate
paedeatric
age
control
group
and
their
mean
values
are
compared
primarily
with
that
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
our
most
recent
studies
confirm
our
earlier
observation
that
children
under
the
age
years
definitely
have
higher
mean
sace
values
than
do
adults
cystic
fibrosis
patients
should
not
be
used
for
comparison
since
they
tend
to
have
lower
sace
levels
than
comparable
aged
controls
in
my
opinion
patients
with
cgd
according
to
the
data
published
by
romer
et
al
show
no
increase
in
sace
levels
for
their
age
