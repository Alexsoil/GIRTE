transport
defect
in

using
the
technique
of
h
ouabain
binding
to
isolate
cells
quissell
and
pitot
concluded
that
the
na
k
atpase
functions
normally
in
fibroblasts
from
cystic
fibrosis
patients
however
this
finding
may
not
be
very
relevant
to
the
na
transport
defect
occurring
in
this
genetic
disease
the
na
transport
abnormality
in
cystic
fibrosis
seems
to
be
confined
to
exocrine
glands
it
is
unknown
at
present
whether
the
defect
resides
in
an
active
or
passive
transport
step
of
the
cation
at
least
with
isolated
sweat
gland
tissue
and
erythrocytes
from
cystic
fibrosis
patients
na
k
atpase
activity
has
been
found
to
be
normal
however
a
decrease
in
the
ethacrynic
acid
sensitive
efflux
a
na
exchange
mechanism
has
been
reported
in
cystic
fibrosis
erythrocytes
these
findings
suggest
that
there
is
no
fundamental
abnormality
in
the
na
k
atpase
enzyme
in
the
disease
but
there
may
be
a
defect
in
an
ethacrynic
acid
sensitive
transport
step
therefore
in
order
to
obtain
a
better
understanding
of
the
cation
transport
defect
one
should
measure
the
binding
of
labelled
ethacrynic
acid
rather
than
ouabain
