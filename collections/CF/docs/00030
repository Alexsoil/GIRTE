in

patients
with

have
tocopherol
deficiency
presumably
as
a
result
of
steatorrhoea
evidence
for
possible
muscular
involvement
in

patients
is

biochemical
creatinuria
on
a

poor
diet
with
reversal
of
this
finding
after
ingestion
of
tocopherol
esters
accompanied
by
a
decrease
in
creatine
in
plasma
and
an
increase
in

in
patients

attending

in

half

received

orally
and
the

placebo
no

was
found
in
