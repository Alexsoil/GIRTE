inhibitory
effect
of
cystic
fibrosis
serum
on
pseudomonas
phagocytosis
by
rabbit
and
human
alveolar
macrophages
this
report
presents
experimental
observations
indicating
the
presence
of
an
inhibitory
activity
in
cystic
fibrosis
cf
serum
which
impairs
phagocytosis
of
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
by
rabbit
as
well
as
human
alveolar
macrophages
of
the
patient
serum
samples
studied
consistently
showed
greater
than
or
equal
to
inhibition
showed
no
inhibition
and
were
in
the
range
of
inhibition
of
pseudomonas
phagocytosis
in
parallel
studies
the
phagocytosis
of
s
aureus
and
s
marcescens
was
found
not
to
be
inhibited
by
cf
serum
mixing
of
cf
serum
with
normal
serum
could
not
overcome
the
inhibitory
effect
indicating
the
presence
of
an
inhibitory
factor
rather
than
the
lack
of
a
necessary
component
the
inhibitory
activity
is
not
lost
upon
exposure
of
serum
to
glass
upon
freezing
the
serum
once
or
upon
heating
at
degrees
c
for
minutes
