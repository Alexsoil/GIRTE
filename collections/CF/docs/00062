serum
proteins
have
been
studied
by
means
of
paper
electrophoresis
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
and
correlated
with
bacteriological
lung
findings
an
increase
of
all
serum
globulin
fractions
in
cf
patients
was
found
whereas
albumin
and
albumin
globulin
ratio
were
decreased
the
changes
in
all
serum
protein
fractions
were
significantly
greater
in
patients
with
constant
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
infection
in
the
lungs
than
in
patients
without
this
constant
infection
p
whereas
patients
with
intermittent
pseudomonas
infection
did
not
have
more
severe
changes
than
patients
without
pseudomonas
infection
the
changes
in
gamma
globulin
and
total
globulin
were
significantly
greater
in
patients
with
frequent
staphylococcus
aureus
infections
than
in
patients
with
rare

infections
p
and
p
respectively
as
regards
the
other
serum
protein
fractions
no
significant
differences
between
patients
with
frequent
and
rare
staphylococcus
infections
were
found
judged
by
simple
scoring
systems
the
lung
disease
of
patients
with
constant
pseudomonas
infection
was
significantly
more
progressed
clinically

radiologically
than
that
of
patients
without

no
significant
differences
