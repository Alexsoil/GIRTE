complement

complement
components
c
c
and
c
a
were
estimated
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
aged
to
years
m
f
and
were
compared
with
results
in
healthy
age
matched
subjects
the
influences
of
the
clinical
score
sputum
microbiology
and
the
patients
sex
were
also
investigated
in
contrast
to
most
previous
communications
this
paper
shows
that
compared
to
the
control
group
a
significant
decrease
of
c
p
less
than
and
c
p
less

was
observed
whereas
c
a
levels
were
not
altered
there
were
no
increases
in
complement
shwachman
scores
above
or
below
did
not
influence
the
complement
levels
nor
did
exacerbations
of
the
disease
change
the
levels
no
influence
of
the
patients
sex
could
be
shown
pseudomonas
aer
in
the
sputum
was
clearly
associated
with
complement
defects
alternative
pathway
involvement
of
complement
activation
could
be
demonstrated
in
the
results
make
complement
activation
due
to
pulmonary
infection
most
likely
the
defects
observed
probably
represent
secondary
changes
