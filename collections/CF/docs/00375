to
determine
the
basis
for
elevated
protein
in
cf
saliva
several
major
proteins
resolved
by
polyacrylamide
disc
gel
electrophoresis
were
quantitated
by
densitometry
these
included
four
phosphoproteins

serum
albumin
an
acid
phosphatase
containing

amylase
and
an
unidentified
protein
referred
to
as
pi
together
these
proteins
comprise
greater

total

the

contributor
to
the
elevated

comprised
of
the
total

of

and
of
the

of

secretions
thus
our
results
do
not
support
the
concept
of
a
generalized
increase
in
all
organic
components
in
cf
submandibular
secretions
but
rather
increases
in
specific
proteins
namely

pi
and
an
