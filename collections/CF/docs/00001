the
significance
of
pseudomonas

infection
in
the
respiratory
tract
of
cystic
fibrosis
patients
have
been
studied
by
means
of
immunoelectrophoretical
analysis
of
patients
sera
for
the
number
of
precipitins
against
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
and
the
concentrations
of
serum
proteins
in
addition
the
clinical
and
radiographical
status
of
the
lungs
have
been
evaluated
using
scoring
systems
precipitins
against
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
were
demonstrated
in
all
sera
the
maximum
number
in
one
serum
was
the
concentrations
of
of
the
serum
proteins
were
significantly
changed
compared
with
matched
control
persons
notably
igg
and
iga
were
elevated
and
the
acute
phase
proteins
were
changed
the
latter
suggesting
active
tissue
damage
the
concentrations
of
of
the
acute
phase
proteins
notably
haptoglobin
were
correlated
to
the
number
of
precipitins
suggesting
that
the
respiratory
tract
infection
in
patients
with
many
precipitins
is
accompanied
by
more
tissue
damage
than
the
infection
in
patients
with
few
precipitins
the
results
indicate
no
protective
value
of
the
many
precipitins
on
the
tissue
of
the
respiratory
