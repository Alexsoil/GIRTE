skin
wrinkling
in
cystic
fibrosis
dr
economou
mavrou
and
his
colleagues
appear
to
have
misunderstood
my
previous
note
concerning
skin
wrinkling
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
range
of
normality
varies
in
different
climatic
conditions
and
in
aukland
wrinkling
does
not
appear
in
cool
tap
water
c
under
minutes
in
normals
skin
wrinkling
on
immersion
appears
to
be
age
related
but
is
difficult
to
detect
reliably
in
the
newborn
prior
washing
of
the
hands
or
immersion
in
sea
water
even
the
day
before
accelerates
skin
wrinkling
as
does
warm
weather
i
would
suggest
that
normality
needs
redefining
in
athens
if
of
normals
were
abnormal
