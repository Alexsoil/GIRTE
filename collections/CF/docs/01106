hydroxycholecalciferol
levels
in
patients

cystic

assessment
of
the
status
of
circulating
vitamin
d
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
was
investigated
by
determining
serum
levels
of
hydroxycholecalciferol
the
majority
of
the
patients
with
cf
and
pancreatic
insufficiency
had
levels
of
oh
d
within
the
normal
range
clinical
symptoms
or
pathologic
signs
resulting
from
deficiencies
of
vitamins
a
and
e
in
patients
with
cf
have
been
repeatedly
documented
in
contrast
a
paradoxical
lack
of
vitamin
d
deficiency
signs
has
been
observed
in
cf
patients
this
is
especially
puzzling
since
rickets
had
been
commonly
associated
with
most
other
forms
of
steatorrhea
we
can
only
speculate
why
rickets
was
formerly
rarely
reported
in
association
with
cf
perhaps
because
of
voracious
appetites
and
the
selective
absorption
of
vitamin
d
via
the
lymphatics
without
requiring
esterification
these
individuals
were
spared
clinical
rickets
