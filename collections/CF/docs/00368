transit
time
analysis
of
the
forced
expiratory
vital
capacity
maneuver
was
applied
to
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
to
years
of
age
this
analysis
divides
the
vital
capacity
into
segments
of
air
and
assigns
a
transit
time
to
each
segment
the
characteristics
of
the
distribution
of
these
transit
times
are
used
as
measurements
of
pulmonary

the

the

had
the

it
was
the

the

was
as
