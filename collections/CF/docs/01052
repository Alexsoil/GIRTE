quality
of
sweat
test
performance
in
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
the
sweat
test
correctly
performed
appears
to
be
reliable
but
results
were
found
to
be
unreliable
about
half
the
time
in
small
community
hospitals
assessed
the
reasons
are
inexperienced
and
untrained
technicians
the
infrequency
of
test
performance
the
use
of
unstandardized
equipment
and
the
lack
of
appropriate
standards
it
behooves
all
clinical
laboratory
directors
to
re
examine
and
standardize
their
procedures
and
use
the
recommendations
of
the
cystic
fibrosis
foundation
physicians
should
be
made
aware
of
the
current
situation
and
send
their
patients
only
to
laboratories
that
perform
the
test
reliably
