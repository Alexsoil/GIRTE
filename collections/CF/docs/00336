proliferation
rates
and
cellular
protein
content
have
been
measured
in
cultured
fibroblasts
derived
from
the
skin
of
normal
volunteers
and
cystic
fibrosis
patients
three
methods
of
measuring
growth
indicated
that
under
our
conditions
cf
fibroblasts
divide
normally
with
a
mean
doubling
time
of
hr
during
the
logarithmic
growth
phase
however
lower
cell
protein
dna
ratios
were
observed
consistently
in
cf
cultures
this
difference
was
not
present
in
contact
inhibited
confluent
fibroblasts
the
finding
of
an
apparent
reduction
in
protein
synthesis
during
rapid
division
coupled
with
an
observation
by
others
that
cf
fibroblasts
fail
to
normally
induce
collagen
formation
suggests
the
possibility
of
a
disturbance
in
the
biochemical
regulation
of
protein
synthesis
