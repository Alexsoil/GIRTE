separation

from
cystic

purified
serum
immunoglobulin
g
igg
derived
from
eight
cystic
fibrosis
cf
and
five
carrier
subjects
has
been
shown
to
be
responsible
for
the
mucociliary
disturbances
noted
in
the
rabbit
tracheal
bioassay
a
small
molecular
substance
of
less
than
but
greater
than
daltons
by
amicon
filtration
was
found
associated
with
gamma
globulin
fractions
isolated
from
sera
of
these
same
cystic
patients
and
their
parents
once
separated
by
pm
ultrafiltration
this
small
substance
was
unable
to
promote
the
ciliary
dyskinesia
response
in
eight
of
eight
cf
and
five
of
five
cf
carrier
individuals
unless
pooled
purified
human
igg
was
added
in
addition
the
igg
rich
fraction
retained
by
pm
ultrafiltration
was
still
able
to
promote
the
ciliary
dyskinesia
response
in
the
bioassay
an
event
noted
in
our
earlier
work
with
whole
serum
the
size
of
the
small
serum
substance
and
its
association
with
igg
closely
corresponds
to
that
described
for
the
oyster
test
system
as
well
as
to
that
produced
by
cultured
cells
derived
from
homozygotes
and
heteroxygotes
for
this
genetic
disorder
the
persistence
of
the
ability
to
promote
mucociliary
disturbances
by
the
igg
rich
retentate
pm
fractions
may
be
indicative
of
the
ineffective
molecular
separation
by
the
amicon
ultransfiltration
apparatus
or
may
represent
another
cf
related
igg
associated
substance
not
influenced
by
ultrafiltration
speculation
the
genetic
disturbance
of
cf
can
be
explained
by
the
presence
of
a
molecule
s
which
has
an
affinity
for
igg
which
in
turn
gives
rise
to
the
various
physiologic
facets
of
this
disorder
this
molecule
s
is
present
in
cf
only
because
of
a
deficiency
of
an
enzyme
which
normally
controls
its
level
by
inactivation
