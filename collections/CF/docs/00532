determination
and
characterization
of
ciliary
atpase
in
the
presence
of
serum
from
cystic
fibrosis
patients
the
purpose
of
this
investigation
was
twofold
to
identify
and
characterize
the
enzymatic
atp
hydrolysis
system
of
epithelial
cilia
and
to
develop
a
quantitative
biochemical
test
for
the
ciliotoxic
cystic
fibrosis
cf
factor
based
on
inhibition
of
atp
utilization
by
ciliary
preparations
our
rationale
for
selecting
this
system
for
cf
factor
analysis
relates
to
the
tight
and
essential
mechanochemical
coupling
of
functioning
cilia
using
rabbit
tracheal
epithelium
as
the
source
a
high
molecular
weight
greater
than
atpase
was
identified
partially
purified
and
extensively
characterized
the
properties
of
this
protein
were
similar
to
those
observed
in
previous
studies
of
others
with
flagellar
and
ciliary
dynein
the
motility
associated
atpase
isolated
from
microorganisms
analysis
of
the
ph
profile
revealed
a
broad
range
of
high
enzymatic
activity
between
and
studies
with
potential
cation
activators
showed
that
the
enzyme
is
activated
equally
by
either
ca
or
mg
in
equimolar
concentrations
no
activation
occurred
in
the
presence
of
zn
na
h
or
na
plus
k
and
the
effect
of
mg
or
ca
was
not
inhibited
by
na
k
or
na
plus
k
the
enzyme
hydrolyzed
mg
containing
solutions
of
utp
ctp
and
adp
at
the
rate
of
atp
dephosphorylation
whereas
mg
deoxy
atp
was
hydrolyzed
as
effectively
as
atp
using
a
newly
devised
analytical
technique
with
gamma
p
atp
as
the
substrate
the
atp
hydrolysis
of
various
ciliary
preparations
from
rabbit
trachea
and
oyster
gill
including
motile
suspensions
was
monitored
in
the
presence
of
sera
from
cf
homo
and
heterozygotes
reproducible
rates
of
atp
dephosphorylation
averaging
nmol
min
mg
protein
were
demonstrable
with
homogenates
of
ciliated
epithelium
none
of
the
test
systems
evaluated
however
were
capable
of
demonstrating
cf
related
differences
in
atpase
activity
or
atp
utilization
although
these
attemps
have
been
unsuccessful
thus
far
the
approach
described
in
this
report
provides
an
example
of
an
objective
quantitative
biochemical
assessment
of
ciliary
function
