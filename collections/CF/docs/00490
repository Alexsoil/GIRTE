current
biochemical
approaches
in
cystic
fibrosis
research
the
clinical
abnormalities
in
cystic
fibrosis
can
be
categorized
into
three
headings
pulmonary
disease
digestive
disorders
and
ion
transport
abnormalities
research
directions
in
cystic
fibrosis
have
evolved
from
observations
of
the
characteristic
malfunctions
inherent
in
the
disease
these
include
defects
in
mucociliary
function
mucous
secretion
membrane
transport
and
glycoprotein
biosynthesis
drawing
from
what
is
known
about
the
bases
of
other
inherited
diseases
one
could
predict
that
cystic
fibrosis
results
from
an
abnormal
functional
protein
as
in
sickle
cell
anemia
an
enzyme
deficiency
as
in
phenylketonuria
or
a
deficiency
of
a
normal
inhibitor
as
in
hereditary
angioedema
