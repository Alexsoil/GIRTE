a

factor
activity
cffa
in
serum
samples
using
bioassays
had
been
reported
to
give
unreliable
results
the
present
study
was
undertaken
to
find
whether
the
use
of
medium
from
short
term
white
blood
cell
or
skin
fibroblast
cultures
rather
than
serum
as
the
test
sample
would
eliminate
such
inconsistencies
short

cultures
were
established
from

the

were
repeated

the
association
of
cffa
in
the
culture
medium
derived
from
individuals
having
allergies
with
the
intermittent
presence
of
this
activity
suggested
that
environmental
factors
induced

the
oyster
ciliary
assay
using
medium
from
white
blood
cell
cultures
cannot
be
used
for
screening
for
the
cf
heterozygote
since
the
substitution
of
culture
medium
for
serum
did
not
eliminate
inconsistent
results
and
cffa
was
not
specific
by
this
assay
for

established
from
