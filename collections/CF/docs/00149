in
pediatrics
liver
spleen
scans
on
children
were
reviewed
retrospectively
with
regard
to
accuracy
and
yield
of
examination
the
scan
predicted
abnormality
correctly
of
the
time
and
normality
correctly
of
the
time
pitfalls
in
interpretation
include
the
nonspecificity
of
abnormalities
present
on
the
scan
confusion
of
extrinsic
with
intrinsic
defects
and
normal
anatomical
variations
with
pathology
the
technetium
m
sulfur
colloid
scan
was
found
to
be
most
helpful
in
diagnosing
splenic
abnormalities
in
working
up
abdominal
masses
and
in
evaluating
tumor
patients
with
a
baseline
scan
it
was
found
least
useful
in
patients
with
fever
of
unknown
origin
abdominal
pain
diffuse
liver
disease
and
most
inflammatory
conditions
liver
abscesses
were
not
found
in
febrile
otherwise
healthy
children
the
iodine
rose
bengal
liver
scan
was
found
to
be
useful
to
differentiate
potentially
curable
lesions

choledochal

from
those

treatable
