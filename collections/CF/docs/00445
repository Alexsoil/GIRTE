it
has
been
reported
that
saliva
and
serum
of
patients
contain
macromolecular
factors
which
are
presumably
cationic
and
inhibit
transport
of
electrolytes
induce
dyskinesis
or
degranulate
sensitized
polymorphonuclear
leukocytes

the
difference
between
levels
of
trypsin
like
activity
of
mixed
saliva
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
controls
has
been
confirmed
a
number
of
studies
have
been
carried
out
in
order
to
determine
if
a
deficiency
of
proteolytic
activity
might
account
for
the
presence
of
cystic

serum
factors
it
was
presumed
that
the
observed
partial
deficiency
of
arginine
esterase
activity
might
well
represent
the
total
deficiency
of
one
of
several
arginine
esterases
assayed
under
the
experimental
conditions
although
it
was
postulated
that
the
deficiency
of
arginine
esterase
activity
is
related
to
the
elevation
of
the
levels
of
polypeptide
or
protein
factors
the
hydrolysis
of
peptide
bands
by
activated
plasma
could
not
be
demonstrated
probably
due
to
the
limitations
of
the
methods
employed
the
deficiency
of
plasma
arginine
esterase
in
cystic
fibrosis
has
been
questioned
and
confirmed
in
another
laboratory
