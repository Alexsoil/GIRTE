phospholipase

alveolar

assays
of
these
enzymes
under
the
same
conditions
in
extracts
of
human
polymorphonuclear
leukocytes
alveolar
macrophages
and
pig
tracheal
mucosa
indicated
that
these
extracellular
airway
enzymes
were
probably
not
derived
from
these
cell
types
although
the
above
three
enzymes
were
present
in
secretions
of
all
patients
with
these
three
diseases
large
amounts
of
palmitoyl
lysolecithin
free
fatty
acids
and
dipalmitoyl
lecithin
were
found
only
in
patients
having
alveolar
proteinosis
and
asthma
the
amount
of
free
fatty
acids
in
these
secretions
was
sufficient
to
inhibit
both
the
lysolecithinase
and
the
lysolecithin
lysolecithin
acyltransferase
but
not
the
phospholipase
a
these
findings
suggest
that
the
large
amount
of
dipalmitoyl
lecithin
free
fatty
acids
and
lysolecithin
found
in
these
secretions
results
from
extracellular
remodelling
by
these
enzymes
because
the
phospholipase
a
was
present
in
large
amounts
it
was
possible
after
delipidation
to
purify
it
to
homogeneity
it
is
a

enzyme
