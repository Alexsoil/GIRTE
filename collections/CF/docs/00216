serum
alpha
fetoprotein
in
cystic
fibrosis
professor
r
k
chandra
and
others
suggest
that
estimation
of
serum
alpha
fetoprotein
afp
might
help
in
detecting
carriers
in
families
at
risk
for
cystic
fibrosis
observers
in
the
u
k
have
been
unable
to
confirm
these
findings
whereas
dr
j
a
smith
of
new
york
supports
them
perhaps
the
crux
of
the
matter
lies
in
the
technique
of
estimating
serum
afp
if
a
small
number
of
families
is
analysed
the
proportion
of
affected
individuals
may
differ
from
the
expected
by
chance
some
families
may
have
all
normal
children
whereas
some
may
have
all
affected
children
for
example
nowadays
since
families
tend
to
be
small
the
appearance
of
an
autosomal
recessive
condition
is
often
sporadic
with
only
one
affected
person
in
the
family
this
could
well
apply
to
cystic
fibrosis
