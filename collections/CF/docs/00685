studies
were
performed
to
demonstrate
possibly
cystic
fibrosis
related
inhibition
of
mucociliary
clearance
in
man
topical
application
of
normal
serum
or
of
cf
serum
did
not
inhibit
in
vivo
nasal
mcc
induction
of
local
inflammation
by
topical
anti
ige
reduced
nasal
mcc
in
cf
subjects
but
increased
mcc
in
normal
individuals
furthermore
nasal
mcc
was
inhibited
in
normal
patients
by
cf
serum
but
not
normal
serum
applied
to
the
anti
ige
treated
nasal
mucosa
these
observations
are
consistent
with
the
hypothesis
that
cf
serum
inhibits
mcc
in
vivo
in
the
inflamed
mucosa
