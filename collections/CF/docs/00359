current
management
of
cystic
fibrosis
although
forty
years
have
passed
since
the
discovery
of
the
clinical
entity
called
for
lack
of
a
better
name
cystic
fibrosis
its
treatment
remains
both
symptomatic
and
controversial
moreover
the
efficacy
of
therapy
has
been
difficult
to
evaluate
for
several
reasons
the
lack
of
a
suitable
animal
model
for
therapeutic
experimentation
the
protean
manifestations
of
the
disease
the
natural
variations
in
its
severity
the
prolonged
periods
of
observation
that
are
required
by
its
very
chronicity
and
frequently
the
lack
of
satisfactory
clinical
parameters
by
which
to
score
response
stated
in
its
simplest
form
the
treatment
of
cystic
fibrosis
is
directed
towards
the
long
term
control
of
salt
loss
malabsorption
and
bronchial
obstruction
the
management
of
several
complications
of
the
disease
and
the
establishment
of
a
positive
therapeutic
environment
that
minimizes
anxiety
and
depression
the
purpose
of
this
review
are
to
help
the
pediatric
practitioner
gain
security
in
his
day
to
day
management
of
children
with
the
disease
and
to
advocate
an
effective
working
relationship
between
the
practitioner
and
a
regional
cystic
fibrosis
or
pediatric
pulmonary
center
for
long
term
patient
management
problems
in

treatment
of

the
