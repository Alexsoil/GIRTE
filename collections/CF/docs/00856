glycoproteins
and
cystic
fibrosis
a
review
this
article
is
a
review
of
the
major
research
of
the
last
years
on
abnormal
glycoproteins
and
abnormal
glycoprotein
metabolism
in
cystic
fibrosis
its
purpose
is
to
focus
attention
on
an
area
considered
by
the
author
to
be
of
great
importance
for
elucidating
the
primary
biochemical
defect
in
cf
the
majority
of
the
studies
on
glycoproteins
in
cf
have
been
done
on
crude
mixtures
of
glycoproteins
from
tissues
or
tissue
fluids
secretions
or
excretions
very
few
studies
have
compared
the
properties
and
composition
of
purified
glycoproteins
from
cf
patients
and
controls
comparative
studies
on
the
enzymes
involved
in
the
degradation
and
biosynthesis
of
the
carbohydrate
portions
of
glycoproteins
in
cf
patients
and
normal
controls
are
discussed
several
studies
have
suggested
abnormalities
in
cf
alpha
l
fucosidase
and
cf
l
fucose
metabolism
there
are
several
studies
which
indirectly
suggest
that
abnormalities
in
glycoproteins
or
their
metabolism
may
be
involved
in
the
pathogenesis
of
cystic
fibrosis
fruitful
areas
for
future
investigation
are
comparison
of
the
properties
and
composition
of
specific
glycoproteins
purified
to
homogeneity
from
cf
and
control
tissues
particularly
with
regard
to
carbohydrate
composition
comparison
of
the
activities
and
properties
of
the
enzymes
involved
in
both
the
degradation
and
biosynthesis
of
glycoproteins
in
cf
and
control
tissues
and
studies
of
the
effects
of
increased
electrolyte
concentration
on
the
physical
chemical
properties
of
glycoproteins
