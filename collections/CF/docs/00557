data
on
the
prevalence
of
divorce
and
separation
among
parents
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
other
chronic
diseases
indicate
that
marital
breakdown
is
no
more
prevalent
among
these
couples
than
it
is
in
a
general
population
for
couples
who
attended
genetic
counseling
clinics
or
had
children
with
spina
bifida
or
leukemia
the
divorce
rate
is
lower
than
the
united
states
national
average
for
parents
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
divorce
rate
is
the
same
as
the
national
average
the
high
recurrence
risk
for
cystic
fibrosis
may
deter
many
parents
from
further
reproduction
we
speculate
that
the
inability
to
plan
more
children
may
be
the
factor
responsible
for
the
higher
prevalence
among
these
parents
compared
to
those
of
children
with
other
chronic
diseases
