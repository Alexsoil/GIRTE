lavage
of

this
study
compared
the
use
of
the
fiberoptic
bronchoscope
with
other
lavage
techniques
under
general
anesthesia
and
of
techniques
using
the

bronchoscope
seventy
seven
procedures
were
performed
on
patients
with
cystic

their
vital
capacities
were
improved
in
of
the
valid
measurements
arterial
blood

levels
showed
improvements
in
of
the

obtained
a
prospective

is
needed
which
incorporates
the
values
of
pre

tlc
flow

and
arterial

values
an
evaluation
of
the
