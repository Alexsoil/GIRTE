reduced
reaction
of
with
plasma
of
patients
with

protease
activity
in
plasma
is
assayed
using
the
assay
is
modified
by
carrying
out
the
reaction
in
the
presence
and
absence
of
benzamidine
a
competitive
inhibitor
of
trypsin
like
proteases
the
parameters
of
the
assay
are
described
in
detail
using
this
assay
our
earlier
demonstration
of
a
deficiency
of
protease
activity
in
plasma
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
is
confirmed
the
activity
corrected
for
the
nonspecific
hydrolysis
of
by
benzamidine
is
expressed
as
nanomoles
of
methylumbelliferone
released
per
milliliter
plasma
under
standard
conditions
the
activity
in
plasma
activated
with
chloroform
ellagic
acid
was
in
controls
in
obligate
heterozygotes
and
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
identical
results
were
obtained
when
unactivated
plasma
was
used
these
data
demonstrate
that
the
judicious
use
of
specific
inhibitors
such
as
benzamidine
might
be
useful
in
assaying
low
levels
of
protease
activity
in
crude
systems
