pseudomonas
colonization
in
cystic
fibrosis
a
study
of
patients
we
investigated
the
role
of
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
colonization
in
the
respiratory
tracts
of
cystic
fibrosis
cf
patients
to
relate
the
effect
of
this
colonization
to
progression
of
bronchial
airway
pathologic
conditions
and
to
the
patients
clinical
progress
and
to
identify
predisposing
factors
to
persistence
of
p
aeruginosa
colonization
and
bronchial
tree
damage
half
of
cf
patients
studied
had
persistent
p
aeruginosa
respiratory
tract
colonization
the
other
half
had
none
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
seems
to
have
an
exclusive
propensity
for
the
respiratory
tract
and
may
appear
at
any
age
treatment
with
antibiotics
including
aminoglycosides
failed
to
eradicate
p
aeruginosa
the
continuous
use
of
antibiotics
seemed
to
contribute
to
the
persistence
of
p
aeruginosa
and
the
appearance
of
mucoid
strains
of
p
aeruginosa
