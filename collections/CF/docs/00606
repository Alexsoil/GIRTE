ventilatory
muscles
can
become
fatigued
and
this
can
contribute
to
respiratory
failure
patients
with
chronic
obstructive
lung
disease
may
benefit
from
improving
their
ventilatory
muscle
endurance
to
improve
resistance
to
fatigue
ventilatory
muscle
endurance
was
measured
in
normal
subjects
and
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
by
finding
the
highest
level
of
normocapnic
hyperpnea
that
could
be
sustained
for
min
subjects
with
cystic
fibrosis
had
per
cent
higher
ventilatory
muscle
endurance
than
normal
subjects
reflecting
the
chronic
training
stress
of
breathing
against
increased
respiratory
loads
four
normal
subjects
and
subjects
with
cystic
fibrosis
participated
in
a
specific
ventilatory
muscle
endurance
training
program
consisting
of
min
per
day
of
maximal
normocapnic
hyperpnea
days
per
week
for
weeks
the
cystic
fibrosis
patients
who
trained
improved
their
ventilatory
muscle
endurance
by
per
cent
whereas
the
normal
subjects
who
trained
showed
a
per

increase
in
ventilatory
muscle
endurance
seven
subjects
with

participated
in
a
week
physical
activity
training
program
consisting
of
at
least
hours
per
day
of
intensive
swimming
and
canoeing
at
summer
camp
they
increased
their
ventilatory

there
were

ventilatory

can
be
