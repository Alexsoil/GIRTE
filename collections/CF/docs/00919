abnormal
levels
of
prostaglandins
and
fatty
acids
in
cystic
fibrosis
letter
like
dr
chase
and
dr
dupont
we
have
found
essential
fatty
acid
deficiency
usually
subclinical
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
however
we
feel
that
their
data
on
prostaglandin
synthesis
may
have
other
interpretations
in
patients
with
deficiency
of
linoleic
acid
oleic
acid
is
used
an
alternative
substrate
and
instead
of
dihomogammalinoleic
acid
an
alternative
fatty
acid
is
produced
we
have
found
increased
amounts
of
this
substance
in
the
plasma
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
we
agree
with
the
authors
conclusion
that
levels
of
linoleic
acid
are
specifically
related
to
p
g
production
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
it
remains
to
be
shown
whether
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
have
a
primary
abnormality
of
fatty
acid
metabolism
or
whether
the
observed
disturbances
of
prostaglandin
metabolism
are
secondary
to
malabsorption
of
dietary
essential
fatty
acids
in
either
case
certain
clinical
features
of
the
disease
may
well
be
explained
by
prostaglandin
disturbances
