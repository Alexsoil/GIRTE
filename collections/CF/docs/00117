fetal
malformations
and
abnormalities
the
prevention
of
fetal
malformations
and
abnormalities
has
long
been
the
hope
of
obstetricians
paediatricians
and
geneticists
but
since
the
cause
of
most
human
malformations
and
of
spontaneous
gene
and
chromosome
mutations
is
unknown
this
must
remain
a
dream
for
the
present
however
with
the
introduction
of
mid
trimester
amniocentesis
it
is
now
possible
to
detect
some
abnormalities
early
enough
for
selective
abortion
of
abnormal
fetuses
though
this
should
be
considered
a
temporary
expedient
only
the
abnormalities
which
are
amenable
to
this
approach
are
the
chromosome
aberrations
such
as
down
s
syndrome
the
neural
tube
malformations
including
spina
bifida
cystica
and
some
recessively
inherited
and
x
linked
metabolic
disorders
