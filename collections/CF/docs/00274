significance
of
absent
vas
deferens
at
hernia
repair
in
infants
and
children
an
absent
vas
deferens
may
be
associated
with
unilateral
renal
agenesis
or
undiagnosed
cystic
fibrosis
such
patients
should
be
further
evaluated
with
a
sweat
chloride
and
intravenous
pyelogram
the
finding
of
absent
vas
deferens
during
exploration
for
an
undescended
testis
does
not
provide
absolute
evidence
for
absence
of
the
testis
since
these
structures
have
independent
embryologic
origins
