the
absorption
of

a

was
measured
by

whole

related

the

storage
iron
in

of

is

the

therapy
and
the

administration

did

there

no
evidence
for
a

inhibiting

in

iron
absorption
is
controlled
also
in
cystic

chiefly
by
the
amounts
of
available
storage
iron
it
is
therefore
not
justified
to
apprehend
the

of

in
