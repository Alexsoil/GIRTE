quantitative

the
development
of
the
exocrine
pancreas
has
been
determined
quantitatively
in
infants
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
both
with
and
without
meconium
ileus
and
in
control
infants
in
the
normal
pancreas
the
ratio
of
acinar
to
connective
tissue
volume
is
at
weeks
postconceptional
age

and
increases
linearly

the

the
