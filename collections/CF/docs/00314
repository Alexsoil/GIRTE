recurrent
acute
pancreatitis
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
with
normal
pancreatic
enzymes
ten
adolescent
and
young
adults
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
have
had
well
documented
recurrent
attacks
of
acute
pancreatitis
the
diagnosis
of
cf
in
each
patient
was
delayed
because
they
did
not
have
pancreatic
insufficiency
the
diagnosis
of
cf
was
documented
by
the
typical
pulmonary
involvement
and
elevated
sweat
sodium
and
chloride
levels
in
all
cases
and
a
positive
family
history
in
six
of
the
ten
patients
two
patients
were
diagnosed
as
having
acute
pancreatitis
before
the
diagnosis
of
cf
was
made
thus
indicating
that
acute
pancreatitis
may
be
the
presenting
complaint
in
the
young
adult
with
cf
the
diagnosis
of
acute
pancreatitis
was
based
on
the
presence
of
severe
abdominal
pain
usually
with
vomiting
tenderness
in
the
mid
epigastrium
elevated
serum
and
urinary
amylase
and
serum
lipase
attacks
were
precipitated
by
fatty
meals
alcohol
ingestion
postcholecystectomy
and
tetracycline
administration
in
some
patients
no
precipitating
event
could
be
elicited
intravenous
secretin
pancreozymin
stimulation
tests
revealed
a
diminished
bicarbonate
secretion
with
little
effect
on
the
secretion
of
the
zymogen
enzymes
a
mild
attack
of
pancreatitis
occurred
after
secretin
pancreozymin
stimulation
the
endocrine
pancreatic
function
tested
in
four
patients
was
normal
as
revealed
by
the
glucose
tolerance
tests
and
determinations
of
serum
insulin
growth
hormone
and
free
fatty
acid
transduodenal
pancreatograms
were
performed
in
three
patients
one
showed
a
normal
pancreatic
duct
one
showed
duct
obstruction
and
in
the
third
patient
a
beady
type
of
narrowing
was
found
the
selenomethionine
se
uptake
of
the
pancreas
was
noted
only
in
the
head
of
the
pancreas
this
suggests
that
loss
of
function
occurs
initially
to
a
greater
extent
in
the
tail
and
body
of
the
pancreas
three
patients
died
and
showed
characteristic
lesions
of
cf
