a
voluminous

has
dealt
with
the

much
of
it
includes
poorly
or
vaguely
documented
observations
only
a
few
facets
have
been
subjected
to
experimental
study
despite
the
resultant
difficulty
in
unraveling
reported
and
inferred
relationships
between
the
two
organs
the
available
information
has
been
analyzed
according
to
the
following
arbitrary
categorization

the

of
the
