evolution
of
plasmids
in
vivo
in
a
strain
of
staphylococcus
aureus
a
strain
of
staphylococcus
aureus
no
far
has
been
isolated
from
a
patient
at
frequent
intervals
over
months
this
strain
has
previously
been
shown
to
lose
resistance
to
several
antibodies
lacey
et
al
during
the
last
months
further
changes
have
occurred
in
it
in
vivo
lincomycin
resistance
appeared
after
the
patient
had
been
treated
with
clindamycin
this
was
due
to
mutation
to
constitutive
resistance
to
both
lincomycin
and
erythromycin
at
a
locus
adjacent
to
that
determining
inducible
resistance
to
erythromycin
both
loci
are
probably
carried
by
an
extrachromosomal
element
three
types
of
variation
in
the
pf
plasmid
were
observed
alteration
in
production
of
penicillinase
from
macroconstitutive
to
microconstitutive
was
not
associated
with
any
detectable
change
in
plasmid
size
this
change
gave
the
cell
an
advantage
in
vitro
because
it
was
associated
with
a
faster
growth
rate
and
probably
also
in
vivo
because
the
microconstitutive
variants
were
isolated
in
increasing
numbers
after
flucloxacillin
therapy
had
ceased
complete
loss
of
determinants
for
penicillinase
production
and
for
resistance
to
cadmium
ions
from
the
pf
plasmid
was
associated
with
a
decrease
in
plasmid
size
of
about
x
daltons
this
change
was
also
associated
with
increased
growth
rate
in
vitro
loss
of
resistance
to
fusidic
acid
from
the
pf
plasmid
was
associated
with
a
decrease
in
plasmid
size
of
about
x
daltons
