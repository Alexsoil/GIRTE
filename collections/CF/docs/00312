complex
saccharide
metabolism
in
cystic
fibrosis
fibroblasts
there
are
several
reports
of
secretory
and
other
abnormalities
present
in
cultured
fibroblasts
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
we
have
therefore
investigated
aspects
of
complex
saccharide
synthesis
and
secretion
by
such
cells
compared
with
fibroblasts
derived
from
heterozygous
hz
parents
and
from
normal
n
children
the
main
glycosaminoglycans
produced
by
skin
fibroblasts
during
in
vitro
culture
were
hyaluronic
acid
heparan
sulfates
and
dermatan
sulfate
like
materials
using
double
label
experiments
with
d
h
or
c
glucosamine
and
analyzing
the
products
by
ion
exchange
chromatography
it
was
shown
for
five
cf
two
hz
and
four
n
lines
that
these
polysaccharides
were
secreted
into
the
medium
in
approximately
similar
proportions
to
each
other
moreover
experiments
in
which
three
cf
nine
hz
and
three
n
lines
were
grown
in
log
phase
for
up
to
days
in
the
presence
of
s
sulfate
and
h
glucosamine
indicate
that
during
such
a
period
cf
fibroblasts
do
not
secrete
complex
carbohydrates
at
rates
significantly
different
from
n
or
hz
cells
neither
do
such
cells
shown
an
abnormal
intracellular
accumulation
of
complex
carbohydrates
the
latter
observation
was
further
confirmed
by
preparing
whole
cell
autoradiographs
during
growth
of
six
cf
two
hz
and
three
n
lines
in
the
presence
of
d
h
glucosamine
and
subsequently
after
addition
of
unlabeled
medium
