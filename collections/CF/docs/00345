isoamylases
and
their
normal
range
of
variation
with
age
the
isoamylases
in
various
human
tissue
homogenates
and
body
fluids
were
separated
by
agarose
gel
electrophoresis
nothing
suggested
any
significant
production
of
amylase
in
the
liver
minute
amounts
of
amylase
belonging
to
the
pancreatic
group
of
isoamylases
might
be
produced
by
the
glands
of
the
proximal
duodenum
the
specific
group
of
isoamylases
produced
in
the
female
genital
tract
could
not
be
demonstrated
in
serum
or
urine
the
activity
of
amylase
in
serum
was
derived
from
two
groups
of
isoenzymes
one
group
originating
from
the
salivary
glands
the
other
from
the
pancreatic
gland
the
contribution
of
each
of
these
two
sources
to
the
total
serum
amylase
was
determined
from
early
foetal
life
to
adult
age
a
very
low
activity
of
the
salivary
isoamylases
was
regularly
found
in
serum
from
week
old
foetuses
the
activity
increased
steadily
with
age
and
reached
the
normal
adult
level
about
u
l
at
the
age
of
years
the
pancreatic
group
of
isoamylases
in
serum
developed
later
the
majority
of
children
below
months
had
no
demonstrable
pancreatic
isoamylase
activity
the
activity
rose
slowly
to
reach
adult
level
about
u
l
at
the
age
of
to
years
the
activity
did
not
vary
with
sex
and
the
diurnal
variation
of
the
isoamylase
was
negligible
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
the
activity
of
pancreatic
isoamylases
in

was
