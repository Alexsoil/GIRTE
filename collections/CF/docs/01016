the

the

on
the

also
studied
the

glycine
taurine
conjugate
ratios

percentage
of
dihydroxy

the

less

total

duodenal

both
quantitatively

bsa

mmol

had
no
inhibitory
effect
on
the
ileal
absorption

these
results
show
pronounced
abnormalities
of
duodenal
juice
bile
salts
in
cf
with
pancreatic
insufficiency
consistent
with
a
broken
enterohepatic
circulation
ehc
such
abnormalities
may
contribute
to
defective
lipid
absorption
in

the
data
in
the
experimental

do
not
support
the
suggestion
that
unhydrolysed
dietary
substrates
play
a
role
