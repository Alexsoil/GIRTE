mucins
from
cystic
fibrosis
sputum
a
biochemical
study
of
bronchial
mucins
in
sputum
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
was
undertaken
in
order
to
determine
their
chemical
features
and
to
compare
them
with
bronchial
mucins
secreted
in
other
physiological
or
pathological
conditions
the
mucins
studied
in
the
present
work
were
obtained
from
the
insoluble
and
fibrillar
part
of
sputum
if
bronchial
mucins
are
the
main
glycoproteins
in
the
fibrillar
mucus
these
data
suggest
that
there
is
a
high
proportion
of
acidic
mucins
within
the
bronchial
secretions
from
cf
patients
the
predominance
of
acidic
mucins
may
not
be
a
specific
feature
of
cf
since
the
sputum
from
the
patients
with
other
diseases
had
a
similar
mucin
distribution
as
far
as
cf
is
concerned
it
is
presently
impossible
to
state
whether
the
bronchial
mucins
represent
normal
mucins
of
the
child
or
structurally
abnormal
molecules
