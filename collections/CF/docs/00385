peliosis
hepatis
in
a
child
peliosis
hepatis
which
has
previously
only
been
reported
in
adults
occurred
in
a
chronically
ill
year
old
boy
with
cystic
fibrosis
as
in
cases
in
adults
chronic
illness
long
term
anabolic
steroid
therapy
and
right
ventricular
congestive
failure
may
well
have
been
the
causative
factors
in
this
case
histologically
the
phlebectatic
and
parenchymal
types
which
were
presumed
to
be
separate
were
found
conjointly
in
this
case
this
is
compatible
with
its
origin
from
severe
right
ventricular
congestive
failure
the
rarity
of
peliosis
however
indicates
that
one
or
more
as
yet
unknown
factors
might
be
operative
in
its
development
