insulin
release
in
cystic
fibrosis
early
insulin
response
to
rapid
intravenous
injection
of
glucose
was
studied
in
cases
of
cystic
fibrosis
aged
months
to
years
plasma
insulin
was
measured
with
a
radioimmunological
method
blood
glucose
values
were
determined
and
the
glucose
disappearance
rate
kg
calculated
in
all
children
except
the
youngest
one
the
early
insulin
response
values
were
low
compared
with
normal
children
the
kg
values
were
normal
and
correlated
neither
to
the
duration
of
clinical
symptoms
nor
to
the
patients
actual
clinical
condition
measured
by
means
of
the
shwachman
score
the
explanation
of
the
decreased
insulin
response
is
probably
the
progressive
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
this
may
also
explain
the
reported
increased
incidence
of
diabetes
mellitus
in
cystic
fibrosis
comparison
is
made
with
the
condition
in
pancreatic
fibrosis
in
rabbits
produced
through
duct
ligation
