a
peroral
test
of
pancreatic
insufficiency
with
n
acetyl
l
tyrosyl
aminobenzoic
acid
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
we
report
on
the
examination
of
stimulated
pancreatic
secretion
using
n
acetyl
l
tyrosyl
aminobenzoic
acid
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
in
controls
the
urinary
excretion
of
aminobenzoic
acid
amounted
to
with
as
the
lower
limit
of
normal
during
six
hours
and
and
during
eight
hours
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
mean
values
were
in
the
six
hour
test
and
in
the
eight
hour
test
both
values
are
significantly
different
in
comparison
with
controls
it
may
be
assumed
that
both
n
acetyl
l
tyrosyl
aminobenzoic
acid
and
n
benzoyl
l
tyrosyl
aminobenzoic
acid
are
suitable
for
indirect
determination
of
exocrine
pancreatic
secretion
in
children
