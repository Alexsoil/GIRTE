showed
that
the
raised
na
concentration
in
the
sweat
of
children
suffering
from
cystic
fibrosis
was
due
to
a
defect
in
na
reabsorption
in
the
duct
epithelium
but
somewhat
surprisingly
the
transepithelial
potential
difference
p
d
is
the
same
as
that
in
normal
controls
na
transport
is
also
reduced
in
the
chronically
ligated
salivary

of
the
rabbit
submandibular
gland
fraser

and
because
p

is
unaffected
the
ligated

may
be
a
useful
model
of
this
aspect
of
cystic

here
we
would
like
to
report
a
further
similarity

duct

which
also
occurs
in
the

in

lev

sections
of
the

were
taken
at

from

which
had
been
ligated
for
between

and
from
their
contralateral
controls
following

by

ligation
resulted
in
an
increase
in
luminal
diameter
by
distension
of
the
previously
convoluted

there
was
no
significant

in

the
number
of

appeared
to
have
increased
however
and
there
was
a

the
