ige
antibody
production
to
exoenzymes
and
common
antigen
oep
of
p

was
studied
in
mice
that
were
injected
with
the
antigens
incorporated
into
water
in

in

elicited

not
capacity
of
the
oep
to
produce
ige
antibody
was
reduced
remarkably
by
it
s
protease
treatment
which
suggested
that
the
capacity
lies
in
the

the

was
less
effective
than
al

in

to
elicit

the

enhanced
the

antibody
response
to

maintained
a

level
for
a
long
period
these
findings
may
suggest
that
ige
antibody
response
to
some
components
of
p

could
be
induced
in

high

observed
