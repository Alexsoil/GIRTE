noninvasive
radionuclide
assessment
of
right
ventricular
performance
in
man
this
chapter
focuses
on
the
application
of
radionuclide
angiocardiography
to
assessment
of
right
ventricular
ejection
fraction
and
the
relationship
between
right
and
left
heart
performance
demonstrated
by
this
technique
prior
to
discussion
of
the
clinical
applications
the
functional
geometry
of
the
two
ventricles
will
be
reviewed
in
addition
the
first
pass
radiotracer
techniques
will
be
compared
to
other
radionuclide
imaging
approaches
of
the
right
heart
first
pass
radionuclide
angiocardiographic
techniques
are
now
suitable
for
clinical
application
they
have
been
validated
and
standardized
and
can
be
relied
upon
for
accurate
reproducible
noninvasive
assessment
of
right
and
left
ventricular
performance
they
already
have
been
applied
to
the
study
of
patients
with
cardiopulmonary
disease
future
directions
will
include
earlier
evaluation
of
myocardial
infarction
application
to
children
and
adults
with
a
variety
of
congenital
cardiac
abnormalities
primarily
those
affecting
the
right
heart
and
assessment
of
the
effects
of
physiologic
stress
upon
right
ventricular
function
with
this
background
valuable
clinical
and
investigative
insights
should
become
available
during
the
coming
years
