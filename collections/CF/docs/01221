a
rapid
procedure
for
the
large
scale
purification
of
elastase
and
cathepsin
g
from
human
sputum
a
procedure
is
described
which
permits
the
rapid
isolation
of
large
amounts
of
elastase
and
cathepsin
g
from
purulent
sputum
this
procedure
involves
digestion
of
sputum
with
dnase
extraction
of
the
insoluble
residue
that
remains
with
m
nacl
ph
affinity
chromatography
on
sepharose
bound
trasylol
and
separation
of
the
two
enzymes
by
chromatogrphy
on
cm
sephadex
starting
with
g
of
sputum
it
was
possible
to
isolate
mg
of
each
of
these
two
enzymes
within
to
days
active
site
titration
indicated
both
enzymes
to
be
at
least
pure
disc
gel
electrophoresis
in
the
presence
and
absence
of
sds
and
amino
acid
sequence
of
the
n
terminal
region
support
the
conclusion
that
the
elastase
and
cathepsin
g
isolated
from
sputum
are
identical
to
the
same
enzymes
isolated
directly
from
the
leukocytes
of
human
blood
