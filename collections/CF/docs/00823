emulsion
in
the
treatment
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
five
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
were
given
repeated
intravenous
infusions
of
soya

emulsion
intralipid
for
to
months
and
the
effects
on
growth
health
sweat
chloride
and
pancreatic
enzyme
activity
compared
with
a
control
group
no
beneficial
effect
was
demonstrated
and
it
is
recommended
that
this
form
of
therapy
has
no
place
in
the
routine
treatment
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
it
is
possible
that
treatment
may
have
modified
the
degree
of
weight
loss
noted
after
months
of
age
the
lack
of
other
beneficial
effects
and
the
problems
involved
in
long
term
intralipid
infusion
should
preclude
the
use
of
this
form
of
therapy
in
the
