on
human
amylase
isoenzymes
the
purpose
of
the
investigation
was
to
elucidate
the
variation
of
the
isoenzymes
of
human
amylase
in
health
and
disease
as
well
as
physico
chemical
differences
between
individual
isoamylases
in
cystic
fibrosis
determination
of
serum
isoamylase
is
of
value
although
absence
of
pancreatic
serum
isoamylase
is
a
normal
finding
during
the
first
year
of
life
demonstrable
pancreatic
serum
isoamylase
in
such
early
life
argues
against
the
diagnosis
after
one
year
of
age
the
test
has
a
positive
diagnostic
value
