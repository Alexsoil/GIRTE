chronic
bronchitis
and
cystic
fibrosis
two
chronic
obstructive
lung
diseases
of
adults
editorial
as
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
survive
longer
the
number
of
adults
with
this
chronic
obstructive
lung
disease
is
increasing
rapidly
chronic
bronchitis
and
cystic
fibrosis
are
similar
in
a
number
of
respects
the
treatment
of
cystic
fibrosis
and
chronic
bronchitis
has
some
similarities
but
chronic
bronchitis
and
cystic
fibrosis
also
differ
in
many
respects
the
pathogenesis
of
chronic
bronchitis
is
more
clearly
related
to
exogonous
factors
such
as
smoking
and
air
pollution
than
is
cystic
fibrosis
which
is
genetically
determined
clinical
differences
also
exist
major
differences
in
treatment
between
cystic
fibrosis
and
chronic
bronchitis
are
currently
in
vogue
because
of
the
special
problems
of
adulthood
it
is
appropriate
that
many
adult
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
be
cared
for
by
internists
who
have
previously
focused
their
attention
on
chronic
bronchitis
and
emphysema
increased
communication
between
internists
and
pediatricians
on
the
issue
of
cystic
fibrosis
is
badly
needed
today
