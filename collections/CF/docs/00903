the

the
terminal

components
c

c
contribute

s
defense

this
study
was
performed
to
determine
if
defective
activation
of
c
to
c
by
bacteria
contributes
to
the
pathogenesis
of
the
recurrent
pulmonary
infections
in
cystic

when
each
of
the
bacteria
was
incubated
in
the
serum
of
patients
with

for
minutes
the
consumption
of

c
was
the

as
in
the
sera

the
control
patients
and
of
the
two
patients
with
chronic

bronchiectasis
based
on
the
results
of
the
present
study
it
is
unlikely
that
defective

of
c

contributes
to
the

of
these
