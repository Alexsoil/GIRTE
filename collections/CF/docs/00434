pathology
of
cystic
fibrosis
pp
the
varied
morphologic
lesions
in
cystic
fibrosis
each
result
from
obstruction
of
one
type
or
another
documented
or
presumed
they
are
modified
by
the
age
of
the
individual
the
severity
and
the
conditions
peculiar
to
each
tissue
these
lesions
plus
the
functional
changes
in
sweat
electrolytes
membrane
transport
and
serum
factor
affecting
syncrony
of
cilia
represent
the
diverse
actions
of
a
genetic
defect
the
intermediate
stages
of
which
are
as
yet
unknown
neither
the
diversity
of
abnormalities
their
range
in
severity
nor
differences
in
the
age
of
onset
argue
convincingly
for
a
trigger
mechanism
or
acquire
rather
than
inborn
deficiency
