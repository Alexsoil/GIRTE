to
geneticists
cystic
fibrosis
perhaps
the
most
frequently
encountered
genetic
disease
among
caucasians
of
european
origin
presents
an
enigmatic
dilemma
on
various
levels
those
problem
areas
which
complicate
our
understanding
of
this
disease
include
methods
of
diagnosis
ascertainment
and
analysis
and
interpretation
of
data
in
spite
of
an
apparently
clear
cut
mode
of
inheritance
autosomal
recessive
several
conceptual
difficulties
exist
in
the
acceptance
of
this
formal
transmission
pattern
the
most
pressing
problem
of
all
perhaps
is
the
population
genetics
of
cf
the
fact
that
a
lethal
gene
may
be
maintained
at
such
elevated
frequencies
and
restricted
to
given
population
groups
represents
a
seemingly
genetic
paradox
our
aim
is
to
review
some
of
the
problems
encountered
in
a
genetic
study
of
cf
and
to
propose
a
theoretical
model
which
may
help
in
their
elucidation
topics
discussed
include
problems
of
diagnosis
ascertainment
and
data
analysis
family
studies
and
inferences
as
to
the
mode
of
inheritance
population
studies
and
a
proposed
model
for
the
inheritance
of
cf
the
main
tenet
of
this
model
states
that
cf
is
determined
by
dominant
alleles
at
two
autosomal
loci
with
interaction
between
them
