serum

faecal
specimens
from

free

cf
and
from
infants
with
the
disease
were
analysed
for
albumin
and
alpha
antitrypsin
content
faeces
from

with
no

had
a
mean
albumin

a
mean
albumin
alpha
antitrypsin
ratio
value

with
one
exception
an
albumin
content
of
more

the

aspirate
from

whose
faeces

had
tryptic
activity
