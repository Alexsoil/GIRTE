introduction
current
investigations
and
theories
on
the
genetic
defect
in
cystic
fibrosis
recent
research
in
cystic
fibrosis
has
suggested
at
least
two
theories
regarding
the
genetic
defect
underlying
this
prevalent
disease
that
a
mutant
gene
in
cystic
fibrosis
genotypes
is
responsible
for
the
synthesis
of
an
altered
protein
that
interferes
with
membrane
transport
and
mucociliary
activity
and
that
a
mutant
gene
in
cystic
fibrosis
genotypes
is
responsible
for
an
enzyme
deficiency
leading
to
the
presence
of
undegraded
metabolites
that
interfere
with
membrane
transport
circulating
factors
in
cystic
fibrosis
and
their
effects
on
membrane
transport
and
mucociliary
systems
are
discussed
as
are
the
search
for
an
enzymatic
deficiency
and
investigations
of
altered
metabolic
pathways
comparison
of
somatic
cells
from
cystic
fibrosis
and
normal
genotypes
is
also
outlined
