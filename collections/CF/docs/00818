conclude
that
the
mass
screening
of
newborn
babies
with
chloride
ion
selective
electrodes
is
a
feasible
method
for
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
they
also
suggest
that
this
procedure
might
be
used
in
conjunction
with
meconium
analysis
to
reduce
the
incidence
of
false
positive
results
in
we
reported
the
details
of
a
child
with
proved
cystic
fibrosis
in
whom
raised
sweat
sodium
but
normal
sweat
chloride
levels
were
obtained
during
treatment
with
cloxacillin
attention
was
drawn
to
the
implication
of
the
finding
with
regard
to
screening
procedures
and
the
suggestion
was
made
that
in
at
least
some
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
cloxacillin
radical
might
replace
the
chloride
ion
in
the
sweat
when
mass
screening
for
cystic
fibrosis
is
to
be
undertaken
using
methods
based
on
the
estimation
of
sweat
chloride
levels
it
is
therefore
prudent
to
inquire
whether
the
infant
is
receiving
medication
from
any
source
and
if
so
to
interpret
the
results
with
caution
these
are
instances
of
false
negative
sweat
chloride
readings
but
there
is
no
evidence
yet
from
our
tests
of
any
negative
cystic
fibrosis
sweat
chloride
the
statistical
chance
of
this
is
in
any
case
small
these
several
cases
suggest
a
need
for
a
systematic
investigation
of
the
effect
of
medication
on
sweat
ion
levels
in
general
as
well
as
in
cystic
fibrosis
cases
