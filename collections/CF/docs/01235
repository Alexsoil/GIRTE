distal
splenorenal
shunt
for
decompression
of
portal
hypertension
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
apart
from
the
sound
physiologic
basis
for
the
distal
splenorenal
shunt
as
compared
with
the
portacaval
shunt
and
the
conventional
central
splenorenal
shunt
there
are
two
important
reasons
why
we
think
the
use
of
this
type
of
shunt
is
especially
advantageous
in
children
with
portal
hypertension
secondary
to
cystic
fibrosis
firstly
the
thick
fibrotic
retroperitoneal
area
in
the
porta
hepatis
where
a
portacaval
shunt
has
to
be
constructed
can
be
avoided
which
makes
the
distal
splenorenal
shunt
the
easier
operation
secondly
notwithstanding
the
relatively
small
sized
vessels
a
wide
anastomosis
can
be
constructed
with
a
high
flow
rate
and
therefore
a
minimal
chance
of
shunt
thrombosis
