effects
of
calcium
on
intestinal
mucin
implications
for
cystic
fibrosis
a
major
feature
of
the
disease
cystic
fibrosis
is
the
excessive
concentration
of
mucus
within
ducts
and
glands
of
mucous
producing
organs
some
mucous
secretions
also
show
an
elevation
in
calcium
concentration
using
purified
rat
intestinal
goblet
cell
mucin
as
a
model
mucin
we
have
investigated
the
effect
of
millimolar
additions
mm
of
cacl
on
the
physical
properties
of
the
mucin
isotonicity
of
incubation
media
was
preserved
in
order
to
mimic
in
vivo
conditions
cacl
mm
caused
a
decrease
in
viscosity
no
change
in
electrophoretic
mobility
in
acrylamide
gels
and
a
decrease
in
solubility
of
the
mucin
solubility
changes
were
reversed
by
the
addition
of
edta
mm
to
incubations
insolubility
was
also
produced
in
incubations
of
mucin
with
a
mixture
of
soluble
intestinal
contents
nacl
washings
these
findings
strongly
suggest
that
the
mucin
became
smaller
and
more
dense
as
calcium
was
added
a
process
most
probably
achieved
by
loss
of
intramolecular
water
