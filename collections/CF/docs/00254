application
of
the
cilia
dyskinesis
test
in
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
an
adolescent
in
certain
cases
of
obscure
chronic
lung
disease
the
possibility
of
a
genetic
disorder
such
as
cystic
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
should
be
considered
when
the
genetic
defect
fails
to
cause
pancreatic
involvement
the
partial
expression
of
cystic
fibrosis
is
encountered
elevation
of
sweat
electrolyte
levels
is
not
sufficient
to
confirm
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
adults
since
normal
levels
vary
widely
in
both
adolescents
and
adults
other
tests
should
therefore
be
utilized
the
cilia
dyskinesis
test
is
positive
in
both
homozygous
and
heterozygous
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
utilization
of
this
technique
in
a
family
study
confirmed
the
diagnosis
of
partial
expression
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
an
adolescent
