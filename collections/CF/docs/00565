characterization

out

gel

confirmed

no

to

molecules
from

as
compared

however
igg
from

demonstrated
increased

of
the

containing
low

serum

after
gel
filtration
in
the

this
suggests
that
very
low
concentrations
of
cfci
are
present
in
media
fractions
and
that
native

igg
cannot
bind
the
low

fractions
to
the

degree
as
native

from
