a
potentially
useful
model
to
study
cystic
fibrosis
one
of
the
most
consistent
characteristics
of
cystic
fibrosis
is
the
abnormal
handling
of
electrolytes
by
exocrine
glands
the
present
study
has
examined
the
possibility
that
diminished
respiratory
energy
formation
is
a
primary
biochemical
error
responsible
for
this
abnormality
using
oxygen
consumption

shrimp
quantitative
differences
have
been
observed
from
reaction
of
mixed
mouth
saliva
between
cf
heterozygotes
and
cf
homozygotes
in
addition
information
demonstrating
a
correlation
between
a
biochemical
abnormality
and
disease
severity
was
observed
the
differences
observed
in
inhibition
by
saliva
from
both
cf
homozygotes
and
obligate
heterozygotes
may
occur
as
the
result
of
interference
with
electron
transfer
from
organic
fuel
molecules
to
molecular
oxygen
or
interference
with
the
mechanism
responsible
for
generating
the
biochemical

necessary
for
