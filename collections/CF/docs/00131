in
neonates
methods
for
the
rapid
semiquantitative
analyses
of
trypsin
and

in
faeces
samples
have
been
developed
the
faecal
sample
is
shaken
with
ph
buffer
and
solutions
containing
enzyme
substrate
buffer
and
indicator
are
added
the
sample
is
incubated
at
degrees
c
for
a
period
dependent
on
the
amount
of
faecal
material
present
and
the
colour
noted
a
change
in
colour
from
violet
to
yellow
trypsin
or
green
to
rose
chymotrypsin
indicates
the
presence
of

using
these
tests
is
being
carried
