increased
uptake
of
s
heparin
by
lymphocytes
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
previous
studies
on
cystic
fibrosis
c
f
have
shown
increased
mucopolysaccharide
synthesis
in
c
f
cells
the
uptake
of
s
heparin
sulphonate
into
purified
lymphocytes
was
examined
after
days
culture
in
medium
supplemented
with
autochthonous
plasma
fourteen
c
f
homozygotes
seven
siblings
and
nine
parents
all
showed
significantly
greater
uptake
p
of
s
heparin
than
cultures
from
twenty
three
normal
controls
there
was
partial
overlap
in
heparin
uptake
values
between
c
f
patients
and
their
families
this
procedure
thus
differentiates
c
f
families
from
the
normal
population
but
does
not
differentiate
c
f
homozygotes
from
heterozygotes
it
is
hoped
that
either
variations
in
culture
methods
or
a
combination
of
this
procedure
with
other
measurements
of
c
f
such
as
ciliary
dyskinesis
or
cellular
metachromasia
will
permit
unequivocal
identification
of
c
f
carriers
