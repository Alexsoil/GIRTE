screening
for
cystic
fibrosis
letter
our
cystic
fibrosis
children
usually
either
have
severe
lung
disease
with
mild
steatorrhea
or
severe
maldigestion
with
lesser
pulmonary
problems
we
therefore
measured
serum
proteases
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
and
controls
to
see
if
there
was
any
support
for
the
following
hypothesis
since
lack
of
antitrypsin
is
associated
with
lung
damage
plasma
trypsin
in
excess
of
antitrypsin
might
be
responsible
for
the
lung
damage
in
cystic
fibrosis
general
protease
and
trypsin
levels
were
measured
spectrophotometrically
using
a
modification
of
the
method
of
erlanger
kojowsky
and
cohen
our
result
showed
no
significant
difference
between
protease
and
trypsin
levels
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
and
controls
the
difference
between
our
results
and
those
of
crossley
et
al
may
be
explained
by
the
differing
measuring
technique
used
our
trypsin
levels
were
measured
spectrophotometrically
and
theirs
by
radioimmunoassay
