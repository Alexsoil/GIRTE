treatment
of
mucus
hypersecretion
in
human
disease
should
first
be
directed
at
prevention
the
hypersecretion
of
mucus
even
in
the
absence
of
pus
in
the
sputum
or
of
other
signs
of
infection
is
of
itself
associated
with
significantly
poor
lung
function
infection
is
probably
the
important
stimulus
in
cystic
fibrosis
certain
anti
inflammatory
agents
are
now
known
to
cause
retention
of
mucus
within
the
secretory
cells
although
the
rate
of
synthesis
is
not
raised
it
may
be
that
this
offers
a
new
way
of
control
on
the
other
hand
the
cells
become
larger
and
this
may
be
undesirable
i
would
prefer
to
see
a
study
of
the
effect
of
drugs
on
the
cellular
stages
of
synthesis
and
discharge
rather
than
concentration
on
mucolytic
agents
