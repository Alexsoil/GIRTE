bioassay
in

we
also
find
cdf
in
fibroblast
media
from

donors

in
amniotic
fluid
cell
media
derived
from

carrier

affected
fetuses

the
media
were
inactive
in

bioassay

became
active
when
mixed
with
purified
igg
in
all
instances
cdf
activity
was
eliminated
by
the
addition
of
anti

we
have
separated
a

since
this

to
be
in

postulate
that
the
primary

in

the
