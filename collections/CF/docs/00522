chemical
composition

sections
of
pancreas
from
individuals
who
died
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
were
classified
by
morphometric
criteria
into
four
categories
in
increasing
order
of
pancreatic
involvement
the
concentration
of
acini
islets
main
ducts
lobular
ducts
connective
tissue
and
fat
was
compared
with
control
levels
the
results
show
that
in
the
least
involved
pancreases
from
neonates
who
died
under
months
of
age
acini
were
reduced
to
of
control
levels
and
the
following
were
increased
islets
to
lobular
ducts
to
and
main
ducts
to
of
controls
with
increasing
severity
of
the
pancreatic
disease
the
acini
were
further
reduced
to
and
lobular
ducts
to
of
control
levels
respectively
main
ducts
increased
by
fold
and
fatty
infiltration
accounted
for
more
than
of
the
fresh
weight
of
the
pancreas
in
of
the
specimens
comparative
biochemical
studies
of
fibrocystic
pancreases
were
quantitatively
related
to

the
pancreatic
involvement
as

water
and
volatile

normally
accounting
for
of
the
weight
of
the
fresh
pancreas
was
reduced
to

elevated
concentrations

were
found
in
