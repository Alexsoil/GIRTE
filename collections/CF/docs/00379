cystic
fibrosis
screening
in
the
newborn
a
new
technique
of
measuring
stool
enzyme
activity
on
dry
specimens
of
faeces
from
newborn
children
at
days
of
age
has
detected
cases
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
the
first
tests
no
known
cases
of
cystic
fibrosis
have
been
missed
additionally
one
case
of
pancreatic
achylia
of
at
least
months
duration
has
been
detected
it
is
proposed
that
the
detection
of
cystic
fibrosis
by
this
technique
is
sufficiently
practical
to
be
acceptable
as
a
worthwhile
newborn
screening
programme
the
screening
test
has
been
in
use
in
auckland
for
over
a
year
and
is
now
being
set
up
in
hamilton
wellington
and
dunedin
