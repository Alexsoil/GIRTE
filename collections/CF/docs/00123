inhibition
of
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
by
ascorbic
acid
acting
singly
and
in
combination
with
antimicrobials
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
studies
ascorbic
acid
acting
on
its
own
is
found
to
exert
a
bacteriostatic
action
in
vitro
on
strains
of
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
tested
this
action
attributable
to
the
oxidation
of
ascorbic
acid
is
dependent
on
individual
strains
and
the
inoculum
size
in
combination
with
sulphamethoxazole
trimethoprim
septrin
ampicillin
erythromycin
chloramphenicol
or
colistin
sulphate
ascorbic

synergistically
on
pseudomonas

experiments

combination
show
that
the
curvative
dose
of
ascorbic
acid
acting
alone
is
milligrammes

this
was
significantly
lowered

the
pseudomonas
