cor
pulmonale
in
children
according
to
the
world
health
organization
chronic
cor
pulmonale
is
defined
as
hypertrophy
of
the
right
ventricle
resulting
from
diseases
affecting
the
function
and
or
the
structure
of
the
lung
except
when
these
pulmonary
alterations
are
the
result
of
diseases
that
primarily
affect
the
left
side
of
the
heart
or
of
congenital
heart
disease
cor
pulmonale
has
been
extensively
studied
and
reported
in
adults
but
it
has
received
relatively
little
attention
in
the
pediatric
age
group
although
some
parts
of
knowledge
gained
from
adult
studies
can
be
used
chronic
cor
pulmonale
in
children
and
infants
is
quite
a
different
entity
from
that
usually
seen
in
adults
this
review
is
primarily
an
attempt
to
clarify
some
of
the
confusion
surrounding
this
subject
and
to
focus
on
the
pediatric
aspects
pathophysiology
etiology
diagnosis
and
treatment
are
discussed
