immunoreactive

trypsin
in
diseases
of
the
pancreas
immunoreactive
serum
trypsin
was
measured
with
a
double
antibody
radioimmunoassay
in
normal
subjects
and
patients
with
various
diseases
of
the
pancreas
the
normal
range
is
ng
ml
with
a
geometric
mean
of
ng
ml
no
trypsin
was
found
in
serum
after
total
duodenopancreatectomy
in
about
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
in
a
few
patients
with
pancreas
carcinoma
or
chronic
pancreatitis
reduced
serum
trypsin
levels
between
and
ng
ml
were
measured
in
the
remaining
of
cystic
fibrosis
and
in
one
third
of
the
patients
with
chronic
pancreatitis
serum
trypsin
was
increased
to
ng
ml
in
all
patients
with
acute
pancreatitis
or
during
the
acute
phase
of
chronic
pancreatitis
absent
or
reduced
serum
trypsin
is
a
reliable
indicator
of
total
or
partial
exocrine
pancreatic
insufficiency
whereas
considerably
increased
serum
trypsin
concentration
do
indicate
acute
pancreatitis
