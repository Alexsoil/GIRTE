the
chronically
reserpinized
rat
has
been
proposed
as
an
animal
model
for
cystic
fibrosis
on
the
basis
of
morphologic
and
secretory
alterations
in
the
submaxillary
gland
and
of
abnormalities
in
pulmonary
secretions
in
this
investigation
the
volume
and
composition
of
pancreatic
juice
from
reserpine
treated
rats
mg
kg
day
have
been
compared
to
those
of
untreated
controls
after
stimulation
with
purified
cholecystokinin
microgram
kg
body
weight
and
with
crude
and
purified
preparations
of
secretin
microns
g
body
weight
infused
iv
for
min
periods
the
results
demonstrate
that
the
treated
animals
secreted
a
significantly
lower
volume
of
pancreatic
juice
after
stimulation
with
these
secretagogues
flow
rates
were
also
significantly
reduced
after
stimulation
with
cholecystokinin
and
crude
secretin
protein
and
amylase
outputs
in
response
to
cholecystokinin
were
smaller
than
in
control
animals
after
unrestritced
feedings
but
greater
after
a
hr
fast
total
bicarbonate
output
was
also
reduced
after
stimulation
with
either
crude
or
purified
secretin
and
the
normal
excretion
patterns
for
bicarbonate
and
chloride
were
either
absent
of
reversed
in
the
secretin
stimulated
pancreatic
juice
of
the
treated
animals
whole
pancreas
homogenates
from
the
treated
animals
showed
significant
increases
in
ca
and
protein
content
these
results
indicate
that
chronic
administration
of
reserpine
alters
the
secretion
of
water
protein
and
bicarbonate
from
the
rat
pancreas
and
that
it
affects
several
of
the
exocrine
glands
involved
in
cystic
fibrosis
these
findings
lend
support
to
the
concept
of
an
animal
model
for
the
human
disease
the
chronic
administration
of
reserpine
to
rats
has
been
shown
to
induce
alterations
in
salivary
and
pulmonary
secretions
which
resemble
those
seen
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
concept
of
an
animal
model
has
been
proposed
on
the
basis
of
these
observations
the
pancreas
is
another
exocrine
gland
prominently
involved
in
cystic
fibrosis
and
if
it
can
be
demonstrated
that
reserpine
administration
also
induces
alterations
in
pancreatic
secretion
the
concept
of
the
animal
model
would
be
strengthened
considerably
