recent
research
in
cystic
fibrosis
this
review
emphasizes
some
of
the
positive
accomplishments
of
cystic
fibrosis
research
some
of
the
puzzles
and
some
of
the
recent
developments
that
have
promise
one
of
the
major
unresolved
questions
is
the
maintenance
of
this
lethal
gene
at
such
a
high
frequency
perhaps
because
of
a
heterozygote
advantage
in
the
past
no
longer
operative
at
present
nothing
is
known
of
the
chromosomal
localization
of
the
trait
except
that
chromosomes
are
morphologically
normal
that
it
is
autosomal
not
sex
linked
and
that
there
is
no
correlation
with
blood
groups
or
major
hla
loci
one
of
the
important
achievements
of
the
past
many
years
is
that
we
understand
relatively
well
the
pathogenesis
of
most
clinical
manifestations
of
cf
the
as
yet
unknown
inherited
basic
defect
or
metabolic
error
of
cf
gives
rise
to
two
main
anomalies
the
electrolyte
defect
in
exocrine
sweat
glands
and
the
mucous
secretion
abnormality
while
the
results
of
tissue
culture
studies
often
have
been
conflicting
and
disparate
it
does
seem
to
be
the
consensus
that
the
fibroblasts
are
affected
by
the
basic
metabolic
error
in
some
manner
and
that
they
respond
abnormally
under
different
experimental
circumstances
virtually
all
investigators
have
found
some
anomalies
in
biologic
fluids
of
cf
although
using
different
approaches
and
methods
an
abnormality
in
the
function
of
the
autonomic
nervous
system
which
is
so
closely
associated
with
the
exocrine
glands
has
always
been
an
attractive
explanation
for
the
generalized
exocrinopathy
of
cf
the
search
for
a
genetic
animal
model
for
cf
has
led
to
interesting
findings
