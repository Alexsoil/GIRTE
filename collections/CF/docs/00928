letter
we
have
investigated
the
fatty
acid
composition
of
serum
lecithins
from
four
groups
of
c
f
patients
defined
by
their
pancreatic
function
evaluated
by
h
quantitative
stool
fat
and
determination
of
the
coefficient
of
fat
absorption
c
f
patients
without
pancreatic
insufficiency
and
not
on
pancreatic
extract
had
significantly
higher
percentages
of
linoleic
acid
than
did
patients
of
any
other
group
the
altered
fatty
acid
composition
of
serum
lipid
fractions
seems
to
be
a
secondary
consequence
of
the
pancreatic
insufficiency
commonly
associated
with
c
f
disease
and
not
a
direct
metabolic
defect
as
some
have
suggested
