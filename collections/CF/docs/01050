a
study
of
erythrocyte
fatty
acids
adenosinetriphosphatase
and
acetylcholinesterase
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
proportions
of
both
saturated
and
polyunsaturated
fatty
acids
were
measured
in
the
erythrocytes
in
cystic
fibrosis
cf
patients
along
with
two
membrane
bound
enzymes
atpase
and
acetylcholinesterase
linoleic
acid
was
found
to
be
significantly
decreased
and
arachidonic
acid
increased
in
cf
patients
the
proportion
of
saturated
fatty
acids
were
not
significantly
different
from
the
controls
only
adenosinetriphosphatase
activity
was
found
to
be
reduced
and
not
acetylcholinesterase
in
cf
patients
