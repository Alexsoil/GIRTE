detection
of
cystic
fibrosis
protein
cfp
using
out
method
involves
rather
exacting
requirements
for
the
collection
of
serum
samples
and
their
subsequent
analysis
by
electrofocusing
minor
variations
in
the
methods
described
for
sample
collection
and
storage
may
cause
degradation
and
loss
of
cfp
and
this
by
itself
could
lead
to
erroneous
results
since
many
cf
samples
would
appear
to
be
cfp
negative
making
it
impossible
to
observe
a
consistent
difference
between
a
group
of
cf
samples
and
normal
control
samples
by
electrofocusing
from
the
results
presented
by
thomas
et
al
and
figure
of
the
letter
by
smith
et
al
it
is
obvious
that
neither
group
has
reproduced
the
protein
handling
patterns
presented
in
either
of
our
previous
reports
the
ph
gradients
are
not
the
same
the
location
of
the
sample
pads
relative
to
the
anode
are
not
the
same
and
the
protein
banding
patterns
are
totally
different
we
question
the
validity
of
the
techniques
used
claims
of
having
reproduced
our
method
for
detecting
cfp
or
supposed
improvements
designed
to
enhance
the
detection
of
cfp
