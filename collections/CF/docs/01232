in
adolescents
and
young
adults
with
the
early
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
and
the
better
management
of
these
patients
in
childhood
increasing
numbers
are
surviving
to
adult
life
the
main
problem
requiring
continuous
medical
care
in
the
older
cystic

patient
is
persisting
and
often
progressive
chest

for
this
reason
the
cystic

was
started
in

had
attended
between
and
eleven
patients
are
alive
and

and
have
shown
no
evidence
of
deterioration
over
this
period
ten
are

it
is
possible
to
give
