lymphocyte
proliferative
responses
to
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
and
staphylococcus
aureus
were
evaluated
in
six
sibling
pairs
with
cystic
fibrosis
in
each
pair
one
sibling
had
advanced
clinical
disease
whereas
the
other
sibling
was
in
good
clinical
condition
three
in
this
latter
group
had
no
clinically
apparent
pseudomonas
bronchitis
in
all
cases
the
average
responses
to
pseudomonas
isolated
from
each
sibling
pair
were
lower
in
the
sibling
with
advanced
clinical
disease
this
difference
was
not
observed
in
the
responses

normal
plasma
or
plasma
from
patients
with

in

does
not
restore
the

in

however
plasma
from
patients
with

inhibits
the

a

play
