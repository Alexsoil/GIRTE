mucoid
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
a
sign
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
young
adults
with
chronic
pulmonary
disease
two
adult
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
had
late
onset
of
symptoms
with
principal
involvement
only
of
the
lungs
the
absence
of
other
typical
features
of
cystic
fibrosis
confused
the
diagnosis
recovery
of
mucoid
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
from
sputum
cultures
helped
to
establish
the
diagnosis
in
these
patients
because
these
mucoid
isolates
are
rarely
obtained
from
subjects
who
do
not
have
cystic
fibrosis
recent
findings
which
have
identified
the
mucoid
isolates
as
predominantly
a
single
strain
of
p
aeruginosa
and
have
documented
its
widespread
carriage
in
the
united
states
by
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
point
to
an
interesting
epidemiologic
relationship
between
this
bacterium
and
this
disease
