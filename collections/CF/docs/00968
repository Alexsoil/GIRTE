cystic

in
southern
africa
including
the
preparation
of
a
register
of
carriers
and
potential
carriers
little
has
been
published
on
cystic
fibrosis
cf
in
whites
in
southern
africa
and
no
figures
as
to
incidence
exist
a
register
of
cf
patients
their
parents
obligatory
carriers
siblings
uncles
aunts
and
first
cousins
potential
carriers
has
been
compiled
for
southern
africa
the
degree
of
co
operation
shown
by
colleagues
and
by
families
whose
addresses
have
been
provided
by
them
and
possible
reasons
for
non
co
operation
are
discussed
from
the
numbers
and
birth
dates
of
patients
a
rough
estimate
of
the
incidence
in
the
republic
of
south
africa
south
west
africa
and
rhodesia
has
been
made
in
all
three
regions
but
especially
in
south
africa
incidence
is
likely
to
have
been
underestimated
details
available
from
the
register
include
the
number
of
cf
patients
alive
and
dead
those
who
presented
with
meconium
ileus
the
number
of
affected
patients
per
family
consanguinity
among
the
parents
or
grandparents
the
frequency
with
which
identical
surnames
were
encountered
and
the
sibship
sizes
of
all
those
on
the
register
towns
and
districts
with
a
population
rich
in
the
cf
gene
are
mentioned
the
number
of
potential
carriers
has
been
determined
so
that
they
can
be
screened
when
a
practicable
detection
test
is
devised
the
register
has
answered
a
number
of
questions
about
cf
in
southern
africa
it
has
focused
attention
on
the
disease
in
the
region
and
played
a
major
catalytic
role
in
the
formation
of
the
southern
