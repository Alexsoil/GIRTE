plasma
arginine
esterase
activity
in
cystic
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
using
a
micro
method
for
the
determination
of
plasma
arginine
esterase
activity
we
have
investigated
the
values
for
soybean
trypsin
inhibitor
sti
inhibited
arginine
esterase
activity
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
obligate
heterozygotes
and
age
matched
control
individuals
the
mean
of
sti
inhibited
activity
is
lowest
for
cystic
fibrosis
patients
while
the
mean
for
normal
controls
is
the
highest
the
mean
of
sti
inhibited
activity
for
the
heterozygotes
is
midway
between
the
values
of
the
patients
and
the
normal
individuals
the
deficiency
of
arginine
esterase
activity
was
statistically
significant
for
both
cystic
fibrosis
patients
and
heterozygotes
