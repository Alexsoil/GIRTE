jejunum
sera
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
cf
and
normal
human
sera
were
assayed
for
the
ability
to
inhibit
sodium

transport
in
rat
brush
border
membrane
vesicles
fresh
cf
and
age

sex
matched
control
sera
were
both
inhibitory
when
compared
to
physiologic
saline
the
inhibition
by
cf
serum
was
mean

at
a
final
serum
concentration
of
at

at

the
ratio
of
the
inhibition
of
cf
sera
compared
to
that
of

sera
was

at

serum
concentrations
respectively
although
a
slightly
greater
inhibition
by
cf
serum
was
observed
at
a
concentration
of
this
is
probably
not
significant
because
no
difference
could
be
detected
at
a
concentration
of
serum
glucose
transport
in
the

of
serum
was
sensitive
to
phlorizin
indicating
that
the
residual
glucose
transport
was
proceeding
by
the
sodium

glucose
transport
system
these
findings
suggest
that
cf
serum
does
not
specifically
inhibit
the
sodium

glucose
transport
system
the
intravesicular
space
accessible
to
glucose
was
reduced
in
the
presence
of

control
serum
fresh
cf
serum
was
times
more
effective
than
fresh
control
serum
p
less
than
the
presence
of
substantial
vesicle
shrinking
activity
in

indicates
that
this
