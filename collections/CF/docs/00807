the
seasonal
variation
of
births
of
offspring
from
couples
heterozygous
for
cystic
fibrosis
to
test
whether
the
month
of
birth
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
is
seasonally
distributed
as
reported
in
a
dutch
survey
published
australian
data
were
examined
and
no
difference
in
the
monthly
variation
was
found
between
births
of
cf
patients
and
their
unaffected
sibs
when
the
two
groups
were
combined
and
analysed
by
periodic
regression
using
successively
higher
fourier
terms
a
significant
fit
to
the
observed
frequencies
was
obtained
with
a
bimodal
curve
possession
of
a
single
cf
gene
seems
therefore
sufficient
for
expression
of
the
cyclic
variation
in
substantial
agreement
with
the
dutch
series
maximum
frequencies
were
found
to
occur
in
march
or
april
and
in
september
it
is
suggested
that
one
or
both
parents
may
be
subject
to
variable
fertility
mediated
by
a
temperature
dependent
mechanism
the
relevance
of
a
periodic
fertility
pattern
in
preserving
the
cf
gene
in
the
population
by
selective
heterozygote
advantage
is
discussed
