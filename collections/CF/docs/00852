activity
of

in

a
new
method
which
uses
a
differential
inhibitor
to
measure
pancreatic
and
salivary
type
alpha
amylases
ec
was
applied
to
serum
samples
from
cystic
fibrosis
cf
patients
age
range
years
and
controls
of
the
same
age
group
the
levels
of
pancreatic
type
amylase
were
lower
in
the
cf
patients
median
i
u
than
the
controls
median
p
less
than
the
results
for
salivary
type
enzyme
however
did
not
support
the
previously
reported
finding
of
higher
than
usual
levels
in
cf
patients
this
discrepancy
is
probably
due
to
differences
in
analytical
methods
it
is
felt
that
this
procedure
will
be
of
value
in
the
investigation
of
patients
for
cystic
fibrosis
and
other
pancreatic
disorders
