letter
dr
hosli
and
esther
vogt
reported
that
the
alpha
mannosidase
and
acid
phosphatase
activities
of
cystic
fibrosis
plasma
assayed
at
ph
are
abnormally
thermolabile
at
degrees
and
degrees
c
respectively
and
that
the
levels
of
residual
activity
after
heat
inactivation
clearly
distinguish
between
cf
patients
cf
carriers
and
normal
subjects
we
have
repeated
these
experiments
under
identical
conditions
and
found
no
differences
between
the
three
groups
