in

we
believe
that
serum
levels
of
individual
complement
components
in
children
cannot
be
meaningfully
interpreted
unless
they
are
compared
with
normal
values
obtained
from
age
matched
controls
in
a
study
of
healthy
infants
and
children
we
found
a
statistically
significant
correlation
of
c
levels
with
age
but
not
with
sex
or
race
and
we
also
found
a
wide
range
of
values
within
any
given
age
group
in
contrast
to
previous
reports
we
did
not
find
raised
c
levels
in
the
majority
of
our
c
f
patients
when
the
values
were
compared
with
projected
group
mean
values
for
the
appropriate
age
and
we
did
not
find
a
significant
elevation
of
the
mean
c
level
for
the
c
f
patients
in
any
of
the
age
groups
tested
