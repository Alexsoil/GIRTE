the
importance
of
intracellular
calcium
ca
in
secretion
and
transmembrane
ion
movement
led
us
to
study
ca
in
cells
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
which
is
a
lethal
genetic
exocrinopathy
skin
fibroblasts
from
patients
with
cf
obligate
heterozygotes
hz
and
age
and
sex
matched
controls
c
were
used
in
matched
pair
experiments
measuring
ca
exchange
into
and
efflux
from
the
cells
over
time
cf
cell
lines
and
hz
cell
lines
exhibit
increased
ca
exchange
when
compared
with
their
respective
controls
p
less
than
the
magnitude
of
this
difference
approximately
is
not
reduced
when
cells
are
washed
with
lanthanum
chloride
after
the
exchange
period
this
difference
is
likely
attributable
to
an
altered
capacity
of
one
or
more
of
the
intracellular
ca
sequestering
organelles
further
evidence
for
this
explanation
was
seen
in
ca
efflux
experiments
in
which
cf
cells
retained
a
higher
percent
of
their
initial
time
ca
than
did
c
cells
late
in
the
efflux
period
p
less
than
the
finding
of
an
altered
ca
pool
size
in
both
cf
and
particularly
hz
cells
suggests
that
altered
ca
metabolism
is
related
to
the
basic
