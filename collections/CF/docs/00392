cystic
fibrosis
at
one
time
was
considered
to
be
a
lethal
condition
with
death
occurring
at
birth
or
within
the
first
year
of
life
with
the
advent
of
antibiotic
therapy
pancreatic
enzyme
replacement
extensive
physical
therapy
and
generally
improved
medical
treatment
many
patients
now
survive
to
adulthood
clinical
manifestations
in
cf
vary
from
patient
to
patient
and
may
include
pulmonary
disease
malnutrition
pancreatic
insufficiency
and
defective
ion
transport
the
most
reliable
laboratory
method
for
diagnosis
of
cf
is
testing
for
elevated
sweat
electrolyte
levels
estimates
of
the
incidence
of
cf
vary
from
in
to
in
among
white
populations
of
mid
european
heritage
the
disease
is
rare
in
black
populations
and
almost
non
existent
in
orientals
since
there
has
been
an
intensive
search
for
a
circulating
factor
or
factors
which
may
be
directly
or
indirectly
responsible
for
the
malfunctions
manifest
in
this
disease
sweat
factors
serum
factors
metachromasia
bioassay
variations
and
properties
of
the
ciliary
inhibitor
are
discussed
several
groups
working
in
cf
research
have
centered
their
attention
on
the
serum
complement
system
agglutination
and
mucus
factors
transport
studies
enzyme
studies
and
prenatal
diagnosis
are
also
examined
