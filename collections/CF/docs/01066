lipids
in
cystic
fibrosis
there
are
certain
aspects
of
the
symptomatology
of
cystic
fibrosis
that
bear
a
resemblance
to
those
of
essential
fatty
acid
deficiency
we
fed
a
group
of
patients
essential
fatty
acids
orally
since
intravenous
administration
is
not
a
practical
method
for
long
term
treatment
results
of
the
study
were
varied
although
some
response
was
noted
in
all
patients
there
were
no
consistent
clinical
changes
seen
in
every
patient
the
oral
efa
therapy
effected
no
change
in
sputum
cultures
after
one
year
of
efa
the
sweat
sodium
concentration
was
lower
in
all
but
one
patient
the
clinical
aspect
of
our
study
is
small
but
promising
the
results
suggest
a
role
for
efas
in
the
care
of
cf
whether
efa
is
a
factor
in
the
etiology
of
cf
or
merely
a
manifestation
of
malabsorption
requires
further
investigation
