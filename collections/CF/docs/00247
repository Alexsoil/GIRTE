screening
for
genetic
disorders
the
past
years
in
developed
countries
have
seen
a
steady
decline
in
infant
mortality
from
diseases
associated
with
infections
and
malnutrition
during
the
period
the
contribution
from
genetic
diseases
and
congenital
malformations
has
risen
significantly
genetically
oriented
screening
programs
have
a
high
potential
to
contribute
to
the
overall
improvement
of
health
in
both
developed
and
underdeveloped
countries
in
this
review
only
procedures
for
screening
for
hereditary
biochemical
disorders
will
be
considered
criteria
for
selection
of
genetic
traits
to
be
screened
the
schedule
for
screening
specimens
for
screening
the

of
newborn
infants
the
testing
of
older
infants
the
testing
of
high
risk
infants
and
children
the
screening
of
families
with
genetic
diseases
and
screening
for

discussed
