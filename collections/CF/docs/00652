environmental
factors
and
diseases
of
the
pancreas
the
five
major
diseases
of
the
pancreas
together
make
a
significant
contribution
to
morbidity
and
mortality
among
the
people
of
the
united
states
these
diseases
are
diabetes
cystic
fibrosis
acute
and
chronic
pancreatitis
and
carcinoma
of
the
exocrine
pancreas
four
of
these
diseases
can
be
modeled
in
laboratory
animals
by
acute
or
chronic
administration
of
chemical
poisons
or
carcinogens
human
pancreatic
diseases
attributed
to
the
effect
of
chemical
agents
including
alcohol
and
drugs
include
many
cases
of
chronic
pancreatitis
and
some
cases
of
acute
pancreatitis
the
cause
is
not
known
in
many
cases
of
human
pancreatitis
including
interstitial
acute
and
chronic
clinical
forms
epidemiologic
studies
suggest
that
the
increasing
incidence
of
carcinoma
of
the
exocrine
pancreas
in
the
united
states
may
reflect
chemical
carcinogenesis
on
the
basis
of
experimental
observations
we
know
that
pancreatic
islet
cells
can
be
damaged
directly
by
toxic
chemicals
and
that
islet
cell
tumors
can
be
chemically
induced
thus
there
is
adequate
background
data
to
conclude
that
several
pancreatic
diseases
of
obscure
etiology
may
be
due
in
part
to
hitherto
unidentified
toxic
effects
of
chemical
agents
encountered
in
personal
or
general
environments
