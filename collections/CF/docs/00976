sputum
viscosity
on
sputum
specimens
selected
from
patients
suffering
from
chronic
bronchitis
bronchiectasis
asthma
and
cystic
fibrosis
total
deoxyribonucleic
acid
dna
content
has
been
related
to
macroscopic
type
to
total
dry
weight
yield
and
to
the
apparent
viscosity
of
the
secretion
at
s
since
dna
may
be
present
either
as
fibres
or
within
cells
in
one
third
of
the
specimens
the
contribution
of
each
form
to
the
apparent
viscosity
was
assessed
the
effect
on
sputum
viscosity
of
the
addition
of
dna
in
vitro
has
also
been
studied
whereas
between
mucoid
mucopurulent
and
purulent
macroscopic
types
a
significant
difference
in
total
dna
and
dry
weight
yield
has
been
found
viscosity
was
not
significantly
correlated
with
purulence
similarly
the
concentration
of
either
cells
or
fibres
correlated
significantly
with
total
dna
but
not
with
viscosity
the
in
vitro
addition
of
dna
to
sputum
caused
a
significant
increase
in
its
viscosity
and
reasons
for
the
differences
between
the
iv
vivo
and
in
vitro
effect
are
discussed
certain
constituents
of
purulent
sputum
tend
to
increase
viscosity
and
others
to
reduce
it
and
the
influence
of
these
varies
in
the
several
diseases
studied
