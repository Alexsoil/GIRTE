hypersensitivity
to
pancreatic
extracts
in
parents
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
because
immediate
hypersensitivity
reactions
can
occur
in
individuals
exposed
to
powdered
pancreatic
extracts
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
patents
of
such
patients
wwer
studied
for
evidence
of
sensitization
sensitivity
to
the
extracts
as
evidence
by
history
and
skin
testing
was
infrequent
in
the
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
however
skin
testing
for
immediate
hypersensitivity
with
either
crude
pancreatic
extracts
or
inactivated
trypsin
correlated
well
in
their
patents
with
a
history
of
clinical
symptoms
ige
mediation
of
these
reactions
in
sensitized
individuals
was
demonstrated
by
antigen

from

passive
