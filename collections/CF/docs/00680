pharmacokinetics
of
methicillin
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
disposition
of
methicillin
in
normal
subjects
and
in
subjects
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
was
studied
after
administration
of
single
intravenous
doses
of
mg
kg
the
area
under
the
serum
concentration
vs
time
curve
for
cf
patients
was
on
the
average
only
of
that
found
for
normal
subjects
the
low
concentrations
in
serum
were
caused
by
more
rapid
urinary
excretion
of
the
antibiotic
with
rates
of
renal
clearance
averaging
ml
min
per
m
in
the
patients
with
cf
and
ml
min
per
m
in
the
normal
subjects
no
differences
were
found
in
volumes
of
distribution
and
metabolic
clearance
rates
of
methicillin
or
in
rates
of
creatinine
clearance
between
the
two
groups
of
subjects
these
data
support
previous
findings
with
dicloxacillin
which
show
that
patients
with
cf
exhibit
unusually
rapid
active
tubular
secretion
of
certain
penicillins
that
may
necessitate
use
of
larger
doses
of
these
drugs
in
treatment
of
infections
