defective
essential
fatty
acid
metabolism
in
cystic
fibrosis
mr
rivers
and
mr
hassam
propose
that
the
subnormal
levels
of
linoleic
acid
found
in
the
plasma
phospholipids
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
are
due
to
malabsorption
to
substantiate
their
hypothesis
they
deduce
that
the
remarkable
remission
observed
in
a
cystic
fibrosis
patient
given
intravenous
intralipid
was
due
not
to
the
content
of
the
triglyceride
component
of
the
fat
emulsion
but
to
the
content
of
its
phospholipid
component
not
as
they
state
this
explanation
seems
unlikely
in
view
of
the
relatively
small
proportion
of
in
intralipid
phospholipid
especially
since
intravenous
administration
of
intralipid
phospholipid
to
healthy
subjects
decreases
both
the
and
content
of
their
plasma
phospholipids
comparison
of
the
effects
of
complete
intralipid
versus
intralipid
phospholipid
on
the
level
of
in
the
plasma
phospholipids
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
would
soon
determine
whether
they
lack
the
ability
to
desaturate
