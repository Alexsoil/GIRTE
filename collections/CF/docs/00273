absorption
of
digoxin
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
absorption
of
digoxin
in
cystic
fibrosis
was
evaluated
in
subjects
by
assessing
the
relationship
between
dosage
expressed
in
mug
kg
day
and
serum
digoxin
concentration
the
results
indicate
that
the
same
relationship
exists
between
maintenance
dosage
and
serum
levels
in
these
patients
and
in
patients
without
cystic
fibrosis
thus
no
evidence
of
impaired
absorption
was
found
