some
materials
on
the
genetics
of
mucoviscidosis
the
purpose
of
the
present
work
was
to
study
the
type
of
inheritance
involved
in
mucoviscidosis
analysis
of
the
genetic
relations
in
mucoviscidosis
performed
on
families
bears
witness
to
a
monomeric
autosomal
mechanism
of
transmission
of
the
character
in
contrast
to
other
recessive
diseases
parental
consanguinity
plays
a
secondary
role
in
mucoviscidosis
which
apparently
is
explained
by
the
wide
distribution
of
the
mucoviscidosis
gene
among
the
population
the
observations
described
may
be
utilized
in
medicogenetic
consultations
given
to
members
of
those
families
where
there
are
children
suffering
from
mucoviscidosis
