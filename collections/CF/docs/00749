concurrently
the

to
be

indicated
that
the

eluted

that
the

removed
all

this

afforded
a

subsequent

allowed
for
the

bio

v
fraction
i
was
shown
to
represent
the

was
determined
to
be
c
a
mw
fraction
i
was
also
found
in
normal
cf
and
carrier
sera
and
therefore
is
not
a
specific
cda
fraction
ii
iv
is
thought
to
represent
a
cf
specific
cda
mw
since
it
could
not
be
demonstrated
in
either
normal
or
asthmatic
sera
but
was
found
in
sera
of
obligate
heterozygotes
fraction
iii
iv
also
did
not
react
with
antisera
to
human
c
a
fraction
v
was
generated
from
all
serum
types
upon
acidification
of
the
serum
with

and
is
thought
to
be
a

respectively
concurrent
analysis
of

for

by

and
for

by

showed
cfp
only
in

provided
evidence
that
cfp
was
associated
with
the

it
is
unknown
as
yet
whether
cfp
itself
is
responsible
for
the
