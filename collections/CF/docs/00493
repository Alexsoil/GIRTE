rna
methylation
and
polyamine
metabolism
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
autosomal
recessively
inherited
disorder
cystic
fibrosis
is
clinically
identified
in
patients
by
the
pathognomonic
finding
of
increased
electrolyte
content
in
the
exocrine
secretion
sweat
two
other
observations
merit
mention
first
the
demonstration
by
magos
of
the
existence
of
a
factor
in
cf
sweat
which
interfered
with
reabsorption
of
sodium
in
the
rat
parotid
secondly
is
the
existence
of
a
cf
serum
component
which
interfered
with
ciliary
rhythm
in
organ
culture
systems
our
investigations
in
cystic
fibrosis
have
been
oriented
towards
the
establishment
of
a
possible
pedigree
of
causes
which
will
unite
all
these
observations
and
secondly
to
develop
a
possible
method
for
heterozygote
detection
cystic
fibrosis
rna
is
relatively
undermethylated
in
comparison
with
contrast
cultures
in
addition
cf
heterozygote
fibroblast
cultures
also
appear
undermethylated
our
interpretation
of
these
data
do
not
imply
a
primary
defect
of
rna
methylases
in
cystic
fibrosis
but
rather
suggested
a
defect
elsewhere
in
biochemical
sequences
involving
methionine
