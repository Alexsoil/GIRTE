immunoperoxidase
demonstration
of
human
serum
globulin
binding
to
islet
tissue
sera
from
juvenile
diabetic
and
nondiabetic
controls
were
tested
using
the
immunoperoxidase
method
for
the
presence
of
islet
binding
immunoglobulins
all
diabetic
sera
tested
contained
an
islet
binding
protein
and
on
the
average
the
sera
were
more
positive
than
age
matched
controls
normal
adult
sera
are
undifferentiated
from
juvenile
diabetic
sera
most
sera
from
children
less
than
two
years
of
age
did
not
bind
to
islet
tissue
and
sera
from
cystic
fibrosis
patients
had
a
markedly
diminished
ability
to
bind
to
islet
tissue
the
binding
protein
appears
to
be
an
immunoglobulin
which
selectively
reacts
with
elements
of
the
islet
beta
cell
