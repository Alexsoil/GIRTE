cystic
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
is
a
recessively
inherited
disorder
generally
considered
to
result
in
chronic
pulmonary
or
digestive
symptoms
therefore
it
may
not
be
readily
appreciated
that
this
disease
can
also
present
with
anemia
edema
and
hypoproteinemia
especially
in
infants
taking
breast
milk
or
soy
based
formulas
the
following
example
involving
monozygotic
twins
given
cow
s
milk
formula
since
birth
will
serve
to
illustrate
this
association
