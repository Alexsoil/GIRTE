effect
of
antibiotics
on
sweat
chloride
levels
in
cystic
fibrosis
we
have
recently
studied
an
year
old
child
with
proved
cystic
fibrosis
in
whom
raised
sweat
sodium
but
normal
sweat
chloride
levels
were
obtained
while
she
was
receiving
cloxacillin
there
was
no
peripheral
edema
or
hypoproteinemia
although
at
necropsy
there
was
evidence
of
biliary
cirrhosis
although
the
sweat
abnormality
might
have
been
due
to
as
yet
unknown
factors
the
temporal
association
with
cloxacillin
administration
suggests
a
causative
relationship
and
it
is
tempting
to
speculate
that
the
anomaly
was
produced
in
this
instance
by
the
substitution
of
the
cloxacillin
radical
for
the
chloride
ion
in
the
sweat
during
the
period
of
therapy
in
light
of
our
findings
it
would
be
of
interest
to
know
whether
the
infant
reported
by
maclean
and
tripp
was
receiving
any
drugs
at
the
time
of
the
initial
sweat
chloride
estimations
and
whether
sodium
estimations
were
also
performed
