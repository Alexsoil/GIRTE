therapeutic
approach
to
pancreatic
extract
induced
hyperuricosuria
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
relationship
between
the
dosage
of
pancreatic
extract
and
the
excretion
of
uric
acid
was
investigated
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
exocrine
pancreatic
insufficiency
urinary
excretion
of
uric
acid
was
normal
in
patients
receiving
small
doses
of
pancreatic
extracts
and
abnormally
high
in
those
receiving
large
amounts
in
the
latter
group
normouricosuria
was
achieved
by
reducing
the
dose
of
pancreatic
extract
normal
stool
patterns
and
adequate
weight
gains
were
preserved
by
a
diet
modification
that
was
well
accepted
by
the
patients
to
eliminate
the
potential
renal
consequences
of
hyperuricosuria
it
seems
appropriate
to
control
the
need
for
increasing
amounts
of
pancreatic
enzymes
by
limiting
the
dietary
intake
of
fat
and
maintaining
a
positive
caloric
and
nitrogen
balance
with
high
intake
of
protein
and
carbohydrates
and
supplementation
with
medium
chain
triglycerides
