renin
like
angiotensinogenase
activity
in

of
patients
with

using

as

renin
like
activity
rla
was
measured
in
eccrine
sweat
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
cf
and
of
controls
sweat
formation
was
induced
by
pilocarpine
iontophoresis
or
by
local
injection
of
carbamylcholine
doryl
rla
values
between
o
not
measurable
and
ng
ml
h
were
measured
with
increasing
sweat
flow
rate
a
tendency
to
lower
rla
values
was
detected
no
significant
difference
was
observed
between
cf
and
controls
from
the
observation
that
rla
of
sweat
is
up
to
times
higher
than
that
of
plasma
it
is
concluded
that
rla
is
probably
released
not
from
plasma
but
from
the
sweat
glands
themselves
where
it
is
stored
or
synthesized
