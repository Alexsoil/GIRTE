electrical
polarization
of
rectal
mucosa
and
excretion
of
tetrahydroaldosterone
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
of
pancreas
and
in
normal
subjects
the
electrical
potential
difference
pd
across
the
rectal
wall
was
measured
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
of
pancreas
cfp
and
in
healthy
subjects
the
pds
obtained
in
normal
children
were
identical
to
those
previously
obtained
in
normal
adults
a
significantly
greater
dispersion
of
the
values
was
observed
in
cfp
when
the
patients
were
divided
into
groups
according
to
metachromasia
in
fibroblast
cultures
the
mean
pd
was
increased
only
in
the
ametachromatic
group
true
enough
this
observation
suggests
a
difference
between
various
forms
of
cfp
distinguished
by
metachromasia
and
thus
is
a
further
indication
of
the
heterogeneity
of
the
disease
the
greater
abnormalities
in
metachromasia
negative
patients
may
however
be
due
solely
to
the
fact
that
these
patients
are
more
severely
affected
by
the
disease
the
urinary
excretion
of
tetrahydroaldosterone
in
patients
was
within
the
ranges
obtained
in
controls
which
excludes
the
possibility
of
secondary
hyperaldosteronism
as
the
source
of
increased
pd
no
evidence
was
provided
in
favour
of
a
basic
defect
in
the
intestinal
transport
of
na
or
cl
minus
but
k
concentrations
in
faecal
fluids
of
patients
were
significantly
lower
than
in
controls
the
equilibrium
concentration
of
k
could
be
accounted
for
by
simple
passive
diffusion
suggesting
that
the
epithelium
behaved
inertly
with
respect
to
this
ion
in
cfp
