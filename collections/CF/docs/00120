at
present
it
is
extremely
doubtful
if
mass
population
screening
for
any
inherited
metabolic
disease
other
than
phenylketonuria
should
be
established
beyond
the
few
pilot
studies
at
present
in
progress
for
many
diseases
although
early
detection
is
clearly
desirable
or
the
technical
means
of
screening
are
available
even
the
establishment
of
pilot
surveys
is
not
yet
indicated
instead
methods
of
screening
more
limited
populations
at
risk
for
particular
disorders
within
a
nationally
coordinated
administrative
structure
should
be
established
those
with
experience
of
mass
screening
for
more
than
one
inherited
metabolic
disease
must
surely
be
convinced
that
in
new
programmes
launched
prematurely
the
harm
caused
by
incomplete
detection
of
cases
or
recognition
of
disorders
whose
management
is
uncertain
or
unavailable
can
far
outweigh
any
benefits
