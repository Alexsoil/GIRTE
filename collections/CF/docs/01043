echocardiographic
profiles
of
the
long
term
cardiac
changes
in
cystic
fibrosis
in
this
echocardiographic
study
assessment
of
the
heart
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
has
shown
that
changes
occur
in
not
only
the
right
ventricle
but
also
in
the
left
ventricle
and
aorta
as
compared
with
normal
echocardiograms
could
be
successfully
performed
in
of
patients
the
thickness
of
the
right
ventricular
anterior
wall
and
the
dimension
of
the
right
ventricular
cavity
were
abnormal
even
in
patients
with
mild
disease
national
institutes
of
health
nih
score
for
severity
of
disease
of
or
greater
larger
older
children
with
lower
nih
score
had
disproportionately
larger
right
ventricular
anterior
walls
and
cavities
the
thickness
of
the
septal
wall
the
thickness
of
the
left
ventricular
posterior
wall
and
the
aortic
dimensions
were
increased
in
those
with
severe
disease
the
dimensions
of
the
left
ventricular
cavity
for
the
population
were
slightly
but
significantly
smaller
than
normal
in
systole
and
in
diastole
throughout
the
course
of
the
disease
this
study
demonstrates
that
echocardiography
is
an
effective
noninvasive
means
of
assessing
the
long
term
changes
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
these
changes
occur
in
both
sides
of
the
heart
and
appear
to
worsen
as
the
disease
progresses
