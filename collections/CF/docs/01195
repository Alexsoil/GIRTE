perspectives
in
cystic
fibrosis
it
would
seem
that
early
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
and
the
institution
of
an
aggressive
treatment
program
before
widespread
irreversible
lung
damage
has
occurred
may
greatly
prolong
survival
individual
prediction
at
the
time
of
diagnosis
is
impossible
but
there
are
a
number
of
factors
which
when
considered
together
enable
the
clinician
to
place
patients
in
a
number
of
broadly
defined
risk
groups
it
is
the
definition
and
characteristics
of
these
groups
which
would
help
the
physician
in
assessment
counseling
and
follow
up
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
which
are
addressed
in
this
article
the
heterogeneity
of
cystic
fibrosis
sex
differences
presentation
and
age
at
diagnosis
pulmonary
function
radiologic
assessment
and
projections
for
the
future
are
discussed
