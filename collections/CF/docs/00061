tobramycin
therapy
of
pulmonary
infections
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
six
patients
having
exacerbations
of
chronic
pulmonary
infections
in
association
with
cystic
fibrosis
were
treated
with
intramuscular
tobramycin
mg
kg
day
in
divided
doses
the
eight
treatment
courses
lasted
to
days
mean
serum
levels
were
microg
ml
at
to
hours
and
microg
ml
at
to
hours
after
a
dose
of
tobramycin
the
mean
tobramycin
concentration
in
sputum
was
microg
ml
eighty
two
percent
of
the
pathogenic
bacterial
isolates
from
sputum
were
either
pseudomonas
sp
or
staphylococcus
aureus
ninety
seven
percent
of
pseudomonas
sp
and
percent
of
staphylococcus
aureus
were
inhibited
by
microg
tobramycin
per
ml
no
organism
that
was
isolated
before
therapy
was
observed
to
become
resistant
to
tobramycin
although
on
occasions
colonization
with
new
resistant
gram
negative
bacilli
occurred
in
out
of
courses
of
therapy
patients
showed
clinical
improvement
elimination
of
bacterial
pathogens
from
the
sputum
was
rarely
achieved
and
was
not
necessary
to
produce
clinical
improvement
colonization
with
resistant
flora
was
an
uncommon
finding
tobramycin
s
side
effects
were
limited
to
local
discomfort
at
the
injection
site
nausea
and
vomiting
