pancreatic
function
and
disease
in
infancy
and
childhood
normal
development
of
the
pancreas
is
of
great
importance
in
the
neonate
and
infant
this
review
evaluates
the
development
of
exocrine
pancreatic
function
the
hormonal
control
of
this
function
the
interrelationship
of
pancreatic
enzymes
and
pancreatic
adaptation
to
food
the
functional
changes
that
occur
in
different
disease
processes
of
the
pancreas
affecting
the
infant
will
also
be
discussed
since
the
treatment
of
pancreatic
exocrine
insufficiency
with
orally
administered
pancreatic
enzymes
in
children
is
often
more
difficult
than
expected
the
practical
approach
to
enzyme
treatment
will
be
discussed

and
congenital

of
