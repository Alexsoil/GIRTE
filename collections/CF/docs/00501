impairment
of
mucociliary
transport
in
cystic
fibrosis
over
the
past
few
years
studies
from
various
laboratories
have
suggested
the
presence
of
a
factor
s
in
cystic
fibrosis
serum
causing
widespread
in
vitro
abnormalities
of
components
of
the
lung
defence
mechanism
particularly
with
respect
to
macrophage
dysfunction
quantitative
and
qualitative
alterations
in
mucus
and
ciliary
motility
the
possible
in
vivo
role
of
ciliary
dysfunction
in
the
pathogenesis
of
the
disease
is
of
particular
clinical
interest
since
an
in
vitro
ciliary
dyskinesia
factor
had
been
previously
demonstrated
and
pulmonary
complications
are
the
hallmark
of
cf
yet
clearance
in
most
of
our
clinically
stable
cf
subjects
was
relatively
well
maintained
this
suggested
to
us
that
a
mucociliary
transport
abnormality
might
be
present
intermittently
in
order
to
explore
this
further
we
designed
nasal
mucociliary
clearance
studies
to
determine
whether
cf
serum
might
exhibit
mct
inhibition
in
vivo
from
these
studies
we
concluded
that
there
was
a
substance
s
in
cf
serum
which
had
the
capacity
to
slow
mct
whether
this
effect
is
on
the
cilia
themselves
or
via
overproduction
of
normal
or
abnormal
mucus
is
not
known
