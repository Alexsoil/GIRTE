cystic
fibrosis
an
autosomal
recessive
trait
is
the
most
common
hereditary
lethal
condition
among
caucasians
approximating
a
prevalence
of
per
births
with
a
carrier
frequency
of
in
populations
originating
from
west
europe
the
markedly
elevated
frequency
of
cf
in
a
considerable
proportion
of
the
human
race
presents
a
genetic
enigma
for
which
several
solutions
have
been
proposed
genetic
heterogeneity
heterozygote
advantage
reduced
penetrance
genetic
drift
and
linkage
or
epistasis
are
discussed
the
basic
defect
in
cf
and
its
fundamental
biochemical
and
physiological
ramifications
are
unknown
