variability
in
cystic
fibrosis
letter
all
of
us
who
care
for
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
are
well
aware
of
the
varying
degrees
of
clinical
involvement
they
have
it
has
long
been
known
that
whereas
the
most
patients
have
pulmonary
involvement
of
one
degree
or
another
approximately
to
of
patients
will
not
have
any
pancreatic
involvement
in
the
to
of
patients
with
pancreatic
involvement
the
degree
of
involvement
can
vary
greatly
if
we
can
accept
the
concept
of
clinical
heterogeneity
for
the
pulmonary
and
gastrointestinal
systems
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
doubt
the
existence
of
clinical
variability
for
the
other
major
organ
system
affected
by
this
disease
the
sweat
glands
