pp
defective
mucociliary
transport
has
been
implicated
in
the
pathogenesis
of
the
lung
disease
in
cystic
fibrosis
based
on
several
observations
first
patients
with
the
disease
secrete
more
mucus
than
normal
subjects
as
indicated
by
gland
hypertrophy
and
frequently
retain
it
in
the
lung
second
the
mucus
is
said
to
have
altered
biochemical
and
rheological
properties
however
although
the
physiochemical
properties
of
mucus
are
altered
in
all
lung
diseases
little
histochemical
or
rheological
difference
has
been
found
in
mucus
from
patients
with
cf
and
other
hypersecretory
conditions
such
as
chronic
bronchitis
and
bronchiectasis
third
a
factor
in
the
serum
of
cf
patients
inhibits
normal
ciliary
activity
in
explain
glands
of
ciliated
epithelium
and
infection
which
damages
human
ciliated
epithelium
in
culture
could
further
reduce
mucociliary
transport
