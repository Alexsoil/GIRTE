screening
for
cystic
fibrosis
cystic
fibrosis
is
a
great
unknown
there
is
a
lot
of
information
about
the
disease
but
no
common
denominator
nothing
to
pull
all
the
pieces
together
it
represents
both
a
diagnostic
and
a
therapeutic
challenge
progress
is
being
made
and
perhaps
someday
we
will
be
able
to
understand
this
complex
entity
