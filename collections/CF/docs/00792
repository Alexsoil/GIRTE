opacification
total
body
opacification
is
the
phenomenon
whereby
introduction
of
iodinated
contrast
material
into
the
blood
stream
renders
structures
differentially
radiopaque
according
to
their
blood
supply
the
term
implies
the
physiology
it
is
the
whole
body
which
is
opacified
in
proportion
to
the
iodine
in
its
plasma
and
extravascular
extracellular
fluid
at
the
time
of
the
radiograph
to
the
density
inherent
in
the
tissue
before
injection
is
added
the
opacity
of
the
iodine
circulating
through
and
transuding
into
it
just
as
tissues
even
those
of
water
density
have
minor
intrinsic
differences
in
x
ray
absorption
so
they
may
also
have
minor
differences
in
blood
flow
and
transudation
into
the
extracellular
fluid
the
combination
of
these
minor
differences
often
makes
the
invisible
visible
