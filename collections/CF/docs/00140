function
in

atpase
activity
and
monovalent

transport
were
examined
in
erythrocytes
rbc
of
subjects
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
the
rbc
membrane
ca
atpase
activity
of
homozygous
patients
and
obligate
heterozygotes
was
indistinguishable
from
that
of
normal
control
subjects
this
was
true
similarly
for
total
ouabain
sensitive
and
ouabain
insensitive
na
k
atpase
total
ouabain
sensitive
and
ouabain
insensitive
na
transport
were
normal
in
cf
cells
ouabain
induced
na
accumulation
was
similar
in
cf
and
normal
rbc
measurements
of
k
transport
in
cf
rbc
were
likewise
normal
we
conclude
that
intrinsic
atpase
and
monovalent
transport
functions
are
normal
in
cf
rbc
we
were
unable
to
confirm
several
abnormalities
in
these
cells
reported
previously
the
cf
rbc
is
not
helpful
in
defining
a
transport
abnormality
in
that
entity
these
studies
document
normal
intrinsic
transport
function
in
rbc
of
patients
with
cf
there
have
been
reports
of
an
abnormal
serum
factor
in
patients
with
cf
this
factor
might
be
involved
in
the
production
of
a
transport
defect
in
cf
further
studies
are
indicated
to
determine
whether
cf
plasma
contains
a
factor
capable
of
altering
membrane
transport
functions
of
normal
rbc
