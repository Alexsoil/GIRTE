mucociliary
transport
in
trachea
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
mucociliary
tracheal
transport
rates
were
measured
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
in
whom
these
rates
ranged
from
to
mm
min
the
patients
were
divided
into
roughly
equal
groups
on
the
basis
of
their
transport
rates
those
in
whom
no
abnormality
in
mucociliary
transport
was
detected
in
the
trachea
those
in
whom
normal
transport
rates
were
measured
but
in
whom
abnormalities
such
as
cessation
or
reversal
of
bolus
movement
were
observed
those
in
whom
no
normal
transport
rates
were
observed
in
the
first
group
the
rates
were
similar
to
those
observed
in
a
population
of
healthy
adults
these
normal
rates
were
observed
in
some
patients
who
had
a
productive
cough
the
mean
mucociliary
tracheal
transport
rate
increased
with
increasing
maximum
midexpiratory
flow
those
patients
with
a
low
shwachman
score
and
poor
arterial
oxygen
tension
tended
to
fall
into
groups
and
in
the
ciliary
dyskinesia
assay
in
rabbit
trachea
the
serum
from
the
patients
with
the
higher
transport
rates
tended
to
initiate
more
rapid
discharge
of
material
from
the
epithelium
and
ciliary
dyskinesia
