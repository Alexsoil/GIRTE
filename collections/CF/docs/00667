carotid
body
hypertrophy
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
cyanotic
congenital
heart
disease
the
carotid
bodies
from
patients
ranging
in
age
from
weeks
gestation
to
years
were
obtained
at
autopsy
patients
were
divided
into
two
groups
based
on
the
presence
or
absence
of
chronic
hypoxemia
there
was
a
high
correlation
between
the
weight
of
individual
carotid
bodies
in
each
case
among
the
patients
with
chronic
hypoxemia
eight
patients
had
carotid
bodies
heavier
than
predicted
by
statistical
analysis
of
these
eight
patients
six
had
cystic
fibrosis
and
two
had
cyanotic
heart
disease
morphometric
and
cell
population
analyses
of
the
carotid
bodies
from
these
eight
patients
and
from
those
of
the
control
population
indicated
that
enlargement
of
the
carotid
bodies
during
normal
or
abnormal
growth
results
from
proportionate
increases
in
lobule
parenchyma
and
stroma
there
was
also
an
increase
in
the
width
and
length
of
the
lobules
without
an
increase
in
the
diameter
of
the
cell
cords
or
a
change
in
the
size
or
proportion
of
the
chief
cells
growth
and
development
of
the
carotid
bodies
were
studied
in
a
control
group
of
patients
without
chronic
hypoxemia
there
were
no
sex
related
differences
in
carotid
body
weights
the
combined
weight
of
the
carotid
bodies
correlated
most
strongly
with
body
weight
although
there
was
some
correlation
with
age
and
body
length
