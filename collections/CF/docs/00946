meconium
screening
for
cystic
fibrosis
in
our
hands
the
bmc
test
meconium
has
been
a
significant
step
towards
the
goal
of
developing
an
ideal
newborn
screening
test
for
cf
it
is
easily
performed
is
highly
specific
has
reasonably
high
sensitivity
and
given
its
limitation
of
identifying
only
patients
with
cf
who
have
intrauterine
pancreatic
insufficiency
is
the
best
method
of
screening
newborns
for
cf
that
has
been
devised
to
date
many
technical
problems
remain
to
be
solved
before
the
test
can
be
endorsed
without
reservation
because
the
test
as
currently
constituted
does
not
identify
all
potential
subjects
for
further
testing
who
might
have
cf
it
should
not
be
made
mandatory
it
is
however
better
than
other
available
screening
methods
for
cf
and
can
be
praised
for
that
benefit
the
concept
has
indicated
a
valuable
new
direction
for
mass
screening
possibilities
and
perhaps
can
by
future
modification
be
made
sensitive
enough
to
warrant
universal
usage
