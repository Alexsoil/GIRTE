this
article
provides
evidence
that
opportunistic
infection
can
be
expected
in
chronically
debilitated
immunosuppressed
persons
the
onset
of
an
infectious
disease
in
these
patients
can
be
sudden
or
insidious
with
few
prodromal
signs
anorexia
malaise
fever
and
vomiting
are
nonspecific
symptoms
that
these
children
may
manifest
because
of
their
primary
illness
or
its
treatment
any
insult
to
natural
defense
barriers
may
cause
serious
infections
in
the
compromised
host
an
infected
wound
from
an
insect
bite
easily
controlled
by
local
measures
in
a
healthy
person
may
become
a
focus
for
septicemia
in
a
child
with
leukemia
despite
the
diagnosis
and
appropriate
treatment
of
the
specific
infection
the
immunosuppressed
person
is
still
subject
to
overwhelming
infection
by
resistant
opportunistic
organisms
until
the
natural
defense
mechanisms
are
restored
an
awareness
of
the
vulnerability
of
the
compromised
host
is
the
key
to
effective
diagnosis
and
management
of
the
various
complications
of
infectious
disease
