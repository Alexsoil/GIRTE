effects
of
cystic
fibrosis
serum
on
the
rat
parotid
gland
injections
of
serum
from
human
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
into
adult
rats
caused
pronounced
structural
modifications
and
increased
mitotic
rate
in
the
parotid
gland
mitotic
rate
was
increased
from
a
low
level
of
acinar
cells
in
parotid
glands
of
adult
rats
to
acinar
cells
after
or
days
of
serum
injection
at
the
light
and
electron
microscopic
levels
significant
acinar
cell
atrophy
and
degranulation
were
observed
cellular
necrosis
and
increases
in
quantity
of
lysosome
like
dense
bodies
mast
cells
and
macrophages
were
also
detected
these
changes
are
suggestive
of
tissue
response
to
injurious
foreign
protein
furthermore
the
fact
that
normal
sera
pronounced
the
same
kind
of
effects
but
greatly
reduced
in
extent
strengthens
the
view
that
these
effects
result
from
the
immunologic
response
of
the
host
organ
to
foreign
antigen
since
however
the
responses
of
the
rat
parotid
to
cystic
fibrosis
serum
were
considerably
more
marked
than
those
elicited
by
normal
serum
the
rat
parotid
may
thus
have
potential
usefulness
in
assaying
for
the
presence
of
human
cystic
fibrosis
factor
