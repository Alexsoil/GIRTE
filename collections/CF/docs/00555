haemophilus
from
the
lower
respiratory
tract
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
fifty
six
non
haemolytic
haemophilus
strains
were
isolated
during
current
bacteriological
examinations
from
material
from
the
lower
respiratory
tract
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
during
a
month
period
except
for
six
strains
which
belonged
to
haemophilus
parainfluenzae
all
strains
were
identified
as
haemophilus
influenzae
biotype
i
of
h
influenzae
was
the
predominating
taxon
and
was
especially
related
to
patients
with
recurrent
or
prolonged
colonization
only
two
strains
were
capsulated
an
unexpectedly
high
percentage
of
the
strains
produced
lysine
decarboxylase
the
significance
of
this
property
in
the
pathogenesis
of
the
respiratory
tract
colonization
is
discussed
