management
of
pneumothorax
in
children
with
chronic
pulmonary
disease
cystic
fibrosis
is
the
most
common
form
of
chronic
pulmonary
disease
in
the
pediatric
age
group
as
these
children
survive
longer
with
improved
therapy
the
incidence
of
pneumothorax
has
increased
in
our
patients
who
were
more
than
years
of
age
the
incidence
of
pneumothorax
was
percent
we
have
reviewed
the
records
of
patients
who
have
had
episodes
of
pneumothorax
complicating
cystic
fibrosis
in
addition
our
experience
includes
one
child
with
histiocytosis
in
whom
pneumothorax
was
a
serious
complication
one
other
pneumothorax
occurred
in
a
teen
age
girl
with
apical
bullous
disease
a
child
who
presents
with
even
a
minimal
pneumothorax
complicating
cystic
fibrosis
is
at
considerable
risk
of
developing
an
increasing
lung
collapse
even
if
the
pneumothorax
resolves
there
is
a
high
risk
of
recurrence
in
children
treated
with
only
a
chest
tube
there
was
a
percent
recurrence
consequently
we
recommend
a
chest
tube
for
any
episode
of
pneumothorax
in
a
child
with
cystic
fibrosis
with
installation
of
a
sclerosing
agent
when
the
lung
expands
three
of
our
patients
so
treated
had
no
recurrence
children
who
have
a
persistent
air
leak
are
confined
to
bed
retain
secretions
and
pursue
a
rapid
downhill
course
a
more
aggressive
approach
to
these
children
consisting
of
thoracotomy
suture
of
the
air
leak
pteural
symphysis
and
pulmonary
lavage
is
feasible
and
the
mortality
rate
is
low
a
pneumothorax
in
a
child
with
no
evidence
of
cystic
fibrosis
is
a
rare
event
a
persistent
air
leak
is
an
indication
for
thoracotomy
suture
of
the
air
leak
and
lung
biopsy
histiocytosis
x
is
one
rare
cause
for
this
complication
in
children
