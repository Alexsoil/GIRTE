pp
cystic
fibrosis
has
been
a
difficult
problem
to
solve
one
amino
acid
is
not
found
in
elevated
concentrations
in
the
urine
one
abnormal
sugar
or
polysaccharide
is
not
found
in
secretions
of
the
bronchial
tree
which
causes
pulmonary
damage
and
a
unique
material
which
inhibits
sodium
transport
has
not
yet
been
identified
in
sweat
instead
of
viewing
the
current
state
of
cf
research
as
chaotic
perhaps
we
should
say
in
a
positive
way
that
the
diversity
of
ideas
stimulates
thinking
and
in
the
process
of
sorting
out
the
primary
defect
a
wide
spectrum
of
pathophysiologic
changes
will
be
recognized
recently
a
positive
charged
polypeptide
associated
with
immunoglobulin
g
has
been
identified
which
may
be
responsible
for
the
ciliary
dyskinesis
effect
of
cf
serum
this
material
should
demonstrate
the
same
properties
when
bound
to
immunoglobulin
g
from
control
sera
it
would
be
interesting
if
it
were
identical
with
the
basic
protein
recently
found
only
in
the
serum
and
igg
fraction
of
cf
patients
and
carriers
further
work
may
identify
how
the
polypeptide
affects
cell
membrane
surfaces
and
whether
a
defective
peptidase
perhaps
an
arginine
esterase
fails
to
break
down
the
polypeptide
a
unifying
hypothesis
could
then
emerge
and
tie
biochemical
and
physiological
findings
together
