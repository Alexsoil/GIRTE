histology
of
nasal
polyps
of
different
etiology
the
aim
of
the
present
study
is
to
elucidate
the
correlation
between
etiology
and
histology
in
nasal
polyps
with
special
regard
to
cystic
fibrosis
cf
nasal
polyps
from
children
with
cf
and
a
control
group
of
non
cf
polyps
from
adult
patients
were
examined
by
light
microscopy
the
histological
evaluation
was
carried
out
on
a
blind
basis
in
order
to
avoid
bias
among
the
parameters
used
the
tissue
eosinophilia
proved
to
be
the
most
valuable
factor
in
the
differentiation
between
cf
and
non
cf
polyps
as
only
few
eosinophils
were
found
in
the
cf
polyps
the
polyp
glands
were
few
and
generally
pathological
some
characteristics
abnormalities
in
the
grandular
morphology
are
apparently
more
common
in
cf
polyps
it
is
concluded
that
the
histological
examination
of
nasal
polyps
is
of
importance
for
the
correct
classification
of
the
patient
but
the
diagnosis
of
cf
cannot
be
made
based
on
microscopy
of
polyps
further
studies
including
blinded
histological
examination
of
nasal
polypous
tissue
might
contribute
to
a
more
differentiated
diagnose
of
nasal
polyposis
