occurrence
and
titres
of
precipitins
against
haemophilus

and
staphylococcus
aureus
by
means
of
crossed
immunoelectrophoresis
with
intermediate

the
patients
had
from
four
to
nine
h
influenzae
precipitins
in
serum
and
in
most
cases
fewer
precipitins
in
sputum
but
on
an
average
there
was
no
difference
between
the
titres
of
the
antibodies
in

most
of
the
antibodies
were
cross
reactive

notably
those
of
the
haemophilus
genus
s

precipitins
were
generally
found
in
higher
numbers
in
serum
than
in

but
on
an

the
titre
of

precipitins
in

was
higher
than

three
of
the
precipitins

detectable
only
in

of

most

these

in
