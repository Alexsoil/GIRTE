measurement
of
electrical
potential
difference
across
colonic
mucosa
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
by
measuring
potential
difference
between
rectal
mucosa
and
perianal
skin
using
a
reference
electrode
placed
on
the
forearm
we
demonstrated
an
altered
potential
difference
in
cystic
children
compared
with
control
adults
and
normal
children
we
suggested
this
might
be
due
to
an
alteration
in
the
rectal
mucosa
potential
or
altered
skin
potential
or
both
in
cystic
fibrosis
we
measured
skin
and
rectal
charges
directly
by
connecting
our
reference
electrode
to
the
blood
stream
through
an
intravenous
line
using
this
technique
we
showed
that
the
cystic
fibrosis
patients
c
f
have
an
abnormal
perianal
skin
potential
difference
compared
with
readings
we
obtained
in
normal
children
there
was
little
difference
in
the
transmural
rectal
potential
difference
between
our
cystic
patients
and
previously
reported
values
in
normal
adults
thus
the
recent
paper
confirms
our
findings
of
normal
polarity
of
the
rectal
mucosa
surface
and
the
increased
skin
polarisation
in
cystic
fibrosis
