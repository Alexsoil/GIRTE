plasma
arginine
esterase
activity
in
cystic
fibrosis
plasma
arginine
esterase
activity
was
measured
in
young
adult
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
in
control
subjects
the
enzyme
was
activated
by
treating
the
plasma
with
chloroform
and
ellagic
acid
in
the
manner
described
by
rao
and
associates
no
difference
was
found
either
between
the
arginine
esterase
activities
of
the
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
the
control
subjects
or
between
the
degrees
of
activity
inhibited
by
soybean
trypsin
inhibitor
thus
the
findings
of
rao
and
associates
of
a
deficiency
of
arginine
esterase
activity
in
the
plasma
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
were
not
confirmed
