essential
fatty
acid
metabolism
in
cystic
fibrosis
in
an
investigation
of
the
effects
of
intestinal
malabsorption
on
plasma
lipids
we
compared
the
fatty
acid
composition
of
the
serum
lecithin
of
patients
with
malabsorption
from
a
variety
of
different
causes
and
found
similar
changes
irrespective
of
the
underlying
cause
of
the
malabsorption
the
only
exception
to
this
was
that
classical
e
f
a
deficiency
was
found
only
in
patients
whose
malabsorption
was
due
to
massive
small
bowel
resection
all
other
causes
of
malabsorption
gave
rise
to
changes
identical
to
those
found
by
other
workers
in
c
f
there
is
thus
no
reason
to
postulate
an
additional
metabolic
abnormality
specific
to
c
f
the
relatively
normal
amounts
of
arachidonic
acid
reported
in
some
e
f
a
deficient
patients
may
not
be
entirely
due
to
arachidonic
acid
