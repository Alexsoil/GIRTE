the
effect
of
early
diagnosis
and
treatment
in
cystic
fibrosis
a
seven
year
study
of
sibling
pairs
data
on
sibling
pairs
with
cystic
fibrosis
were
analyzed
to
test
the
hypothesis
that
early
treatment
of
this
condition
improves
prognosis
younger
siblings
conditions
were
diagnosed
before
year
of
age
usually
before
the
onset
of
pulmonary
disease
older
siblings
conditions
were
diagnosed
after
year
of
age
and
after
the
onset
of
pulmonary
disease
although
the
sibling
pairs
received
similar
treatment
comparison
at
years
of
age
showed
that
the
younger
siblings
had
significantly
better
chest
roentgenogram
scores
total
clinical
scores
residual
lung
volumes
and
ratios
of
residual
volume
to
total
lung
volume
younger
siblings
also
required
fewer
hospital
admissions
to
control
their
lung
disease
the
results
suggest
that
in
general
early
initiation
of
therapy
is
beneficial
for
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
