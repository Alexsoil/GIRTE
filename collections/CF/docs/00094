cystic
fibrosis
with
edema
and
falsely
negative
sweat
test
the
recent
interesting
report
on
cystic
fibrosis
with
edema
and
falsely
negative
sweat
test
prompted
us
to
report
a
similar
case
the
previously
reported
similar
cases
and
this
one
suggest
that
when
cystic
fibrosis
is
suspected
in
an
edematous
infant
and
the
sweat
chloride
or
sodium
concentration
is
within
the
normal
range
the
test
should
be
repeated
after
the
edema
has
disappeared
