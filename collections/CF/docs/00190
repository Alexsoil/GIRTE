studies
on
the
synthesis
of
plasma
membrane
proteins
of
fibroblasts
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
characteristic
increased
salinity
of
sweat
and
other
abnormalities
of
exocrine
secretions
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
suggest
the
possibility
of
a
disturbed
functioning
of
the
plasma
membrane
in
this
disease
several
lines
of
evidence
indicate
that
fibroblasts
express
the
presence
of
the
cf
genotype
therefore
these
cells
were
used
in
an
in
vitro
study
directed
at
determining
whether
the
manifestations
of
cf
might
be
related
to
an
alteration
of
one
or
more
of
the
protein
components
of
the
plasma
membrane
in
order
to
evaluate
the
synthesis
of
these
components
growing
fibrosblasts
from
patients
with
cf
and
normal
subjects
were
briefly
exposed
to
either
c
or
h
leucine
their
plasma
membranes
were
then
isolated
and
subjected
to
analysis
in
a
nondetergent
acrylamide
gel
system
coelectrophoresis
of
differentially
labeled
preparations
revealed
the
absence
of
a
detectable
abnormality
in
the
synthetic
rates
of
any
of
the
more
than
resolved
protein
species
