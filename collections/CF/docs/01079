the
immotile
cilia
syndrome
and
other
ciliary
diseases
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
review
to
present
evidence
for
a
disorder
which
is
believed
to
be
caused
by
defective
cilia
and
to
review
some
data
on
the
occurrence
of
abnormal
cilia
evidently
formed
in
response
to
environmental
insults
the
cilium
human
ciliated
structures
the
immotile
cilia
syndrome
and
other
inborn
ciliary
diseases
cystic
fibrosis
and
acquired
disorders
of
ciliated
structures
are
discussed
ciliary
activity
is
not
vital
but
its
loss
will
cause
a
great
deal
of
discomfort
the
greatest
problems
relate
to
the
lower
respiratory
tract
which
is
also
a
site
of
most
of
the
cilia
in
the
body
it
is
striking
that
a
certain
degree
of
clearance
can
be
maintained
in
the
lungs
in
the
absence
of
motile
cilia
by
coughing
hawking
and
other
mechanisms
