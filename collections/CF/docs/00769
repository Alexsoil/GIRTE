antibody
response
to
enterobacterial
lipoprotein
of
patients
with
varied
infections
due
to
enterobacteriaceae
the
present
study
was
initiated
to
determine
the
antibody
response
to
lipoprotein
of
patients
with
various
enterobacterial
infections
this
investigation
was
also
considered
important
because
patients
with
these
infections
respond
differently
to
another
antigen
common
to
enterobacteriaceae
the
common
enterobacterial
antigen
included
were
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
complicated
by
enterobacterial
respiratory
tract
infection
the
lipoprotein
lp
antibody
levels
of
healthy
subjects
and
of
patients
with
varied
enterobacterial
infections
were
determined
none
of
the
healthy
children
and
only
one
of
the
healthy
adults
had
antibodies
against
lp
in
contrast
of
the
children
with
peritonitis
complicating
appendicitis
of
patients
with
enterobacterial
infection
of
the
respiratory
tract
complicating
cystic
fibrosis
and
of
adult
subjects
with
bacteremia
complicating
malignancy
had
lp
antibodies
in
the
serum
the
reason
for
these
striking
differences
in
the
immune
response
to
this
common
antigen
remains
to
be
elucidated
