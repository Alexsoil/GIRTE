malabsorption
laboratory
diagnosis
of
malabsorption
syndromes
in
children
is
more
difficult
for
obvious
reasons
involving
the
collection
of
specimens
the
early
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
is
extremely
urgent
since
the
disease
is
treatable
the
standard
test
is
the
sweat
test
over
percent
of
patients
with
this
disease
will
have
elevation
of
sodium
and
chloride
in
the
sweat
three
tests
are
used
to
assess
pancreatic
function
first
is
the
measurement
of
stool
trypsin
and
chymotrypsin
second
stimulation
with
hormones
the
standard
secretin
and
cck
tests
a
third
procedure
tests
carbohydrate
tolerance
an
increasingly
important
test
since
an
ever
growing
number
of
patients
in
late
childhood
and
early
adulthood
with
cystic
fibrosis
are
being
found
to
have
diabetes
mellitus
the
commonest
and
most
important
hereditary
disease
that
affects
pancreatic
function
is
cystic
fibrosis
the
commonest
form
of
pancreatic
insufficiency
in
childhood
is
mucoviscidosis
or
cystic
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
the
incidence
of
this
disease
is
approximately
one
per
live
births
it
occurs
in
all
races
and
the
defect
is
transmitted
as
an
autosomal
recessive
the
classic
features
are
frequent
bowel
movements
with
the
characteristic
appearance
of
steatorrheic
stools
and
a
failure
to
grow
and
develop
normally
