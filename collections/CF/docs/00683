nasal
polyps
in
cystic
fibrosis
in
ii
polyps
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
the
density
shape
and
architecture
of
mucous
glands
were
studied
by
the
whole
mount
method
and
compared
with
non
cystic
fibrosis
polyps
there
were
no
differences
in
density
which
was
in
most
polyps
less
than
gland
mm
the
shape
and
architecture
as
well
as
other
histological
appearances
of
the
polyp
were
also
alike
in
both
groups
of
polyps
which
could
not
be
distinguished
the
pathogenesis
of
nasal
polyps
in
cystic
fibrosis
is
discussed
apparently
it
is
the
same
as
that
of
non
cystic
fibrosis
polyps
