medical
mucoid
lesions
of
the
pulmonary
artery
in
cystic
fibrosis
pulmonary
hypertension
and
other
disorders
alterations
in
the
pulmonary
vascular
bed
were
reviewed
in
the
autopsy
material
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
and
cor
pulmonale
hypertrophy
of
the
media
or
intimal
proliferation
of
small
muscular
arteries
and
arterioles
was
noted
in
eight
patients
intimal
proliferation
of
the
larger
caliber
arteries
was
seen
in
seven
patients
the
unexpected
change
however
was
the
presence
of
interstitial
hyaline
material
in
the
media
of
the
pulmonary
artery
or
its
major
branches
in
one
third
of
the
specimens
the
elastic
fibers
were
distorted
but
not
disrupted
and
the
finding
was
unrelated
to
the
presence
or
severity
of
other
vascular
changes
intimal
deposits
of
the
same
material
were
also
present
in
seven
of
the
patients
with
intimal
proliferation
in
major
pulmonary
arteries
identical
medial
lesions
were
found
in
the
pulmonary
arteries
of
seven
of
children
with
pulmonary
hypertension
and
in
seven
patients
with
other
disorders
similar
lesions
in
the
media
of
the
aorta
were
found
in
each
group
of
patients
the
material
was
not
schiff
reactive
but
had
the
histochemical
characteristics
of
a
connective
tissue
acid
mucopolysaccharide
