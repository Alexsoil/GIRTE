the

induced
in
cultured
human

by
dibutyryl
cyclic
amp
sodium
butyrate
the
serum
glycoprotein
fetuin
the
tamm
horsfall
urinary
glycoprotein

by
a

of
inhibitors
of

the

basal
enzyme
activity
increased
at
later
stages
of
growth
when
the
cells
became
confluent
induction

or
fetuin
was
most
effective
when
the

were
added
after
the
