a
novel
technique
has
been
employed
to
demonstrate
that
alpha
l
fucosidase
purified
from
cystic
fibrosis
and
control
livers
exhibits
differential
binding
to
the
lectin
concanavalin
a
the
concentration

to
prevent
binding
of
alpha

to
concanavalin
a

considerably
lower

comparable
results
were
found
when
binding
studies
were
done
on
crude
supernatant
alpha

from

plus

and
plus

respectively
without
any
overlap
of

between

these
results
suggest
that
comparative
lectin
binding
studies
on
cystic
fibrosis
and
normal
glycoproteins
from
readily
available
tissues
might
result
in
an
assay
for
detecting
