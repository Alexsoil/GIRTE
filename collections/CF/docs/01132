we
have
studied
serum
angiotensin
converting
enzyme
sace
in
sarcoidosis
and
other
granulomatous
disorders
we
have
measured
sace
in
randomly
chosen
consecutive
patients
with
chronic
granulomatous
disease
cgd
and
in
some
of
their
family
members
and
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
severe
chronic
pulmonary
involvement
sace
levels
in
the
patient
with
cgd
differed
significantly
from
those
of
normal
controls
and
those
of
family
members
and
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
our
preliminary
studies
show
that
cgd
is
associated
with
increased
levels
of
sace
