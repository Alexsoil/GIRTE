assays
of
carboxypeptidase
b
like
activity
and
c
in
serum
from
patients
with

and
appropriate
control
subjects
failed
to
demonstrate
a
deficiency
of
carboxypeptidase

a
consistent
increase
in
c
as
was
suggested
by

and
associates
differences
between
men
and
women
with
cystic

were
apparent
in
that
women
with

had
higher
