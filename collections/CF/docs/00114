invertebrate
model
for
study
of
macromolecular
regulators
of
mucus
secretion
large
molecules
which
consistently
stimulate
hypersecretion
in
individual
mucus
secretory
sells
in
an
animal
system
the
marine
invertebrate
sipunculus
have
been
found
in
human
serum
and
urine
this
activity
is
heat
evoked
in
serum
heat
labile
in
urine
heat
stable
and
heat
evoked
factors
were
also
found
respectively
in
saliva
and
tears
the
serum
and
urine
factors
withstood
freeze
thawing
activity
of
both
factors
was
destroyed
by
pronase
and
activity
of
the
urine
factor
was
destroyed
by
trypsin
after
incubation
with
alphaamylase
the
factor
in
urine
induced
production
of
a
very
aberrant
type
of
secretion
