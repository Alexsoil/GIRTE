letter
screening
for
cystic
fibrosis
we
read
with
interest
dr
raine
s
paper
but
would
like
to
stress
that
hellsing
and
kollberg
used
a
single
radial
immunodiffusion
method
not
radioimmunoassay
prosser
et
al
demonstrated
quite
clearly
that
similar
results
were
obtained
in
cystic
fibrosis
c
f
screening
with
test
strips
and
with
more
elaborate
methods
of
albumin
detection
in
meconium
using
both
radial
immunodiffusion
as
well
as
test
strips
kollberg
s
group
noticed
a
decreased
albumin
content
in
c
f
meconium
stored
at
room
temperature
and
mailed
for
several
days
diminished
albumin
concentration
might
have
been
brought
about
by
remaining
proteolytic
activity
prosser
et
al
found
no
change
in
albumin
content
during
refrigerator
storage
approximately
of
c
f
cases
have
no
raised
albumin
content
in
meconium
and
this
problem
has
not
yet
been
solved
