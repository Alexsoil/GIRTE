protein
level
in
the
meconium
of
a
homozygotic
and
a
heterozygotic
infant
with
cystic
fibrosis
in
our
patient
the
second
child
of
a
married
couple
heterozygous
for
cystic
fibrosis
the
meconium
protein
content
was
higher
than
that
of
controls
he
has
no
symptoms
of
cystic
fibrosis
the
determination
of
sodium
and
chloride
ions
in
the
sweat
excluded
homozygosity
the
bromide
test
led
us
to
conclude
the
child
to
be
a
heterozygote
in
our
patient
the
protein
content
of
the
meconium
the
majority
of
which
was
albumin
was
two
to
threefold
that
of
the
controls
this
elevated
protein
content
however
was
not
characteristic
of
homozygosity
our
results
lead
us
to
conclude
that
a
high
protein
content
of
meconium
does
not
unconditionally
indicate
the
homozygotic
state
for
cystic
fibrosis
it
would
appear
that
heterozygosity
for
cystic
fibrosis
is
not
completely
without
abnormality
our
findings
perhaps
explain
false
positive
results
recorded
in
the
literature
high
protein
content
in
the
meconium
may
be
useful
in
the
identification
of
heterozygotes
too
