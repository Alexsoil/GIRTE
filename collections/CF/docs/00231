copper

from
normal
children
and
patients
suffering
from
cystic
fibrosis
c
f
the
copper
content
of
finger
nail
clippings
and
toe
nail
clippings
were
determined
from
this
study
it
can
be
concluded
that
although
the
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
c
f
have
a
higher
copper
content
the
determination
of
copper
in
nail
samples
cannot
be
used
in
order
to
differentiate
between
normal
children
and
patients
also
higher
mean
copper
concentrations
were
found
in
finger
nail
clippings
in
comparison
with
toe
nails
this
difference
was
significant
for
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
