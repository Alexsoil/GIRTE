the
pulmonary
circulation
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
hearts
and
lungs
of
patients
dying
of
cystic
fibrosis
have
been
studied
to
establish
the
relationship
between
right
ventricular
hypertrophy
rvh
pathological
changes
in
the
pulmonary
circulation
and
the
clinical
features
the
presence
and
degree
of
rvh
were
measured
by
fulton
s
technique
of
weighing
the
ventricles
separately
of
the
subjects
who
died
after
the
age
of
years
one
in
six
had
no
rvh
although
the
mean
age
of
this
group
was
not
significantly
different
from
that
of
the
remainder
there
was
no
correlation
between
duration
of
cyanosis
haemoglobin
levels
and
rvh
although
not
statistically
significant
the
cases
without
rvh
tended
to
have
had
clubbing
of
the
finger
nails
for
longer
periods
before
death
the
electrocardiogram
was
useful
in
the
diagnosis
of
rvh
right
ventricular
hypertrophy
was
common
in
children
with
lungs
of
large
volume
as
judged
by
the
radiographic
centile
of
lung
length
cases
with
rvh
show
reduced
background
haze
in
the
arteriogram
and
fewer
arteries
per
unit
area
of
lung
for
the
first
time
thickening
of
the
medial
muscle
layer
proportional
to
the
degree
of
rvh
has
been
demonstrated
only
in
the
smaller
arteries
arterial
subintimal
fibrosis
is
more
common
in
cases
with
rvh
as
is
thickening
of
the
walls
of
small
pulmonary
veins
the
implications
of
these
findings
are
discussed
