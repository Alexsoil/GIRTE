pancreatic
supplementation
for
premature
babies
letter
for
some
time
now
we
have
been
using
a
screening
test
for
cystic
fibrosis
based
on
levels
of
stool
trypsin
and
chymotrypsin
on
the
fourth
day
of
life
one
interesting
observation
is
the
number
of
premature
babies
who
have
little
or
no
pancreatic
trypsin
or
chymotrypsin
at
this
time
for
example
of
the
babies
tested
from
st
helen
s
maternity
hospital
between
june
and
april
were
classified
as
premature
in
the
birth
records
book
samples
were
received
for
only
of
these
babies
of
these
babies
had
stool
trypsin
levels
of
microg
per
g
compared
with
only
of
the
other
babies
tested
during
this
period
as
may
be
expected
the
lower
birth
weight
babies
tend
to
have
lower
stool
enzyme
concentrations
we
feel
that
our
data
indicate
that
at
least
some
premature
babies
would
benefit
from
pancreatic
enzyme
supplementation
or
predigested
foods
in
the
first
few
days
after
birth
