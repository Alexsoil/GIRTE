to

effect

nocturnal

cf
of

severity
two
matched
groups
each
consisting
of
children
with
cf
were
studied
during
months
on
mist
tent
therapy
and
months
of
therapy
the
progression
in
airway
obstruction
was
measured
by
change
in
serial
measurements
of
maximal
midexpiratory
flow
mmef
from
which
a
regression
equation
of
mmef
against
time
was
obtained
for
each
individual
changes
in
mmef
value
with

without

were
compared
in
patients
matched
for
severity

disease
as
indicated
by
initial
mmef
values
for
the
group
as
a

no
differences
were
found
in
the
progression
of
the
airway

whether
the
patients
received
mist
tent

not
this

the
groups
of
children
with
cf
who
had
early
moderate

advanced
airway
obstruction
as
judged
from
their
initial
mmef
value
it
is
concluded
that
nocturnal

neither

its
