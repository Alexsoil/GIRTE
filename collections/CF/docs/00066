diminished
excretion
of
bicarbonate
from
the
single
sweat
gland
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
using
ph
microelectrodes
the
excretion
of
hydrogen
ions
and
bicarbonate
in
relation
to
flow
rate
was
investigated
in
a
single
sweat
gland
of
cystic
fibrosis
children
the
results
show
decreased
excretion
of
hydrogen
ions
and
an
increased
excretion
of
bicarbonate
evidence
is
presented
that
due
to
reduced
secretion
of
hydrogen
ions
in
the
duct
both
the
reabsorption
of
sodium
and
the
secretion
of
potassium
may
be
impaired
reduced
flux
of
protons
across
the
luminal
membrane
of
epithelial
cells
is
proposed
as
a
general
feature
of
exocrine
gland
defects
it
is
then
possible
to
describe
both
the
cationic
transport
defect
of
the
sweat
gland
duct
and
the
anionic
bicarbonate
secretory
defect
in
one
