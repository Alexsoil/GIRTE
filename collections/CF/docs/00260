pseudomonas
aeruginosa
isolates
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
of
the
pancreas
in
seven
hospitals
were
serotyped
with
the
agglutination
systems
of
homma
and
fisher
et
al
the
two
systems
were
complementary
strains
from
cf
patients
were
much
less
likely
to
furnish
a
stable
type
on
repetitive
typing
tests
than
strains
from
other
patients
this
was
related
to
the
frequent
occurrence
of
mucoid
p
aeruginosa
strains
the
strains
were
divided
among
homma
serotypes
a
single
homma
type
type
capable
of
mucoid
growth
comprised
cf
strains
eight
serotypes
were
detected
in
strains
from
cf
patients
in
one
hospital
three
strains
were
detected
in
one
hospital
cf
unit
and
two
strains
were
detected
in
each
of
five
hospital
cf
units
the
cf
serotype
comprised
from
to
of
cf
strains
in
the
seven
hospitals
these
p
aeruginosa
strains
dissociated
in
vivo
as
judged
by
mucoid
and
nonmucoid
colonies
on
primary
culture
plates
and
continued
to
dissociate
during
subcultures
both
colony
type
were
the
same
serotype
the
tendency
to
regard
colonial
phenotypes
mucoid
nonmucoid
rough
as
separate
strains
was
erroneous
repetitive
typing
with
the
two
systems
gave
better
results
than
a
single
system
the
mucoid
p
aeruginosa
strain
is
probably
spread
from
patient
to
patient
rather
than
acquiring
its
mucoid
characteristic
de
novo
in
the
cf
patient
it
is
not
known
why
the
mucoid
cf
strain
has
a
peculiar
predilection
for
cf
patients
nor
why
it
generally
loses
the
quality
in
culture
but
retains
it
indefinitely
in
the
patient
