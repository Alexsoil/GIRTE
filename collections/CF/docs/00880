cystic
fibrosis
in
israel
clinical
and
genetic
aspects
a
total
of
cases
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
families
was
identified
in
israel
during
the
years
and
there
was
reason
to
suspect
inadequate
ascertainment
cystic
fibrosis
is
frequent
among
the
ashkenazic
and
arab
populations
with
an
incidence
approximating
that
for
caucasians
of
european
ancestry
to
live
births
it
is
about
half
as
frequent
in
the
sephardim
rare
in
the
iraqi
or
yemenite
jews
and
perhaps
absent
in
iranian
jews
the
clinical
picture
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
israel
in
all
the
ethnic
groups
was
found
to
be
the
same
as
elsewhere
in
the
world
in
depth
interviews
of
families
were
conducted
to
assess
their
understanding
of
the
genetics
of
the
disease
and
their
attitude
toward
family
planning
