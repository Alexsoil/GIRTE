a
method
for
analysing
fertility
of
heterozygotes
for
autosomal
recessive
disorders
with
special
reference
to
cystic
fibrosis
tay
sachs
disease
and
phenylketonuria
increased
fertility
of
heterozygotes
with
respect
to
decreased
foetal
loss
among
offspring
of
heterozygotes
has
been
proposed
by
several
authors
as
a
possible
explanation
for
the
high
gene
frequency
of
cf
tsd
and
pku
in
certain
populations
studies
comparing
reproductive
outcome
of
heterozygotes
with
reproductive
performance
in
the
general
population
or
in
special
control
groups
have
been
done
on
several
occasions
these
studies
however
are
known
to
be
heavily
biased
on
the
one
side
by
the
fact
that
ascertainment
of
heterozygotes
through
affected
offspinrg
will
tend
to
underestimate
the
relative
frequency
of
smaller
families
and
on
the
other
side
because
of
the
inadequacy
of
census
data
for
comparison
and
the
biases
inherent
in
selection
of
control
families
careful
analysis
of
the
biases
involved
provides
suggestions
for
proper
corrections
from
this
a
method
has
been
developed
which
offers
a
better
approach
to
the
study
of
heterozygote
fertility
in
those
autosomal
recessive
conditions
which
lack
a
test
for
direct
heterozygote
detection
