comparative
trial
of
pancrex
v
forte
and
nutrizym
in
treatment
of
malabsorption
in
cystic
fibrosis
a
cross
over
trial
of
pancreatic
enzyme
replacement
therapy
has
been
conducted
on
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
using
pancrex
v
forte
and
nutrizym
tablets
in
equivalent
dosage
no
differences
were
found
in
the
effectiveness
of
these
products
as
measured
by
stool
volume
number
of
bowel
actions
faecal
fat
excretion
and
urine
urea
excretion
neither
product
eliminated
the
steatorrhoea
though
there
was
no
laboratory
evidence
to
support
their
choice
nine
patients
expressed
a
preference
for
nutrizym
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
this
preference
was
based
partly
on
the
smaller
number
of
tablets
which
are
required
