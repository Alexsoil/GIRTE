pancreatic
extracts
in
the
management
of
cystic
fibrosis
the
university
of
kansas
group
have
established
that
pancreatic
extracts
in
the
doses
currently
used
in
the
management
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cause
hyperuricosuria
which
may
occasionally
be
symptomatic
they
correctly
worry
about
long
term
ill
effects
of
such
therapy
in
treated
cf
patients
the
uricosuria
results
primarily
from
the
increased
dietary
purine
load
though
the
abnormal
transport
physiology
in
cf
may
contribute
even
though
final
evidence
on
risk
is
not
at
hand
prudence
would
suggest
holding
the
purine
load
in
cf
patients
to
the
minimum
needed
to
ensure
digestion
of
sufficient
foodstuffs
without
necessarily
permitting
a
normal
diet
sans
steatorrhea
alternatively
purified
enzyme
preparations
free
of
the
remaining
sweetbread
could
eliminate
the
excess
nucleic
acid
intake
and
be
administered
in
a
dosage
permitting
the
luxury
of
redundant
safety
