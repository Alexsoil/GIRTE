water
and
electrolytes
of
exocrine
secretions
pp
it
has
been
recognized
that
the
levels
of
water
and
electrolytes
are
deranged
in
many
if
not
all
of
the
exocrine
secretions
of
cystic
fibrosis
patients
the
sodium
and
chloride
levels
in
serous
secretions
from
cf
patients
are
elevated
in
contrast
the
more
protein
rich
or
mucoid
isotonic
secretions
viz
from
the
pancreas
and
tracheobronchial
mucus
glands
are
found
to
have
sodium
concentrations
near
normal
or
even
somewhat
decreased
however
these
secretions
have
significantly
reduced
water
content
the
abnormalities
in
hypotonic
secretions
appear
to
rise
from
a
decreased
na
reabsorption
in
the
ducts
the
low
water
content
of
the
isotonic
secretions
of
cf
patients
appears
to
result
from
decreased
secretion
of
water
and
electrolytes
early
studies
on
tracheobronchial
secretions
from
cf
patients
led
investigators
to
suggest
that
the
primary
defect
may
be
a
decrease
in
the
levels
of
water
and
monovalent
ions
in
an
attempt
to
provide
a
unifying
hypothesis
it
has
been
suggested
that
an
increased
calcium
concentration
in
the
various
exocrine
secretions
leads
to
a
hyperpermeability
of
the
mucus
linings
and
thus
to
an
excessive
loss
of
water
and
small
ions
the
concentration
of
calcium
in
exocrine
secretions
appears
to
follow
the
concentration
of
proteins
and
especially
the
mucous
glycoproteins
it
was
suggested
that
calcium
may
be
an
important
factor
in
the
increased
viscosity
and
insolubility
of
cf
mucus
organic
ions
are
also
potential
perturbants
of
macromolecular
structure
in
addition
to
a
possible
perturbant
role
polyamines
have
a
potential
role
in
water
and
electrolyte
transport
