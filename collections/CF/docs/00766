diploid
skin
fibroblasts
derived
from
several
unrelated
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
were
tested
for
resistance
to
the
cytotoxic
effects
of
ouabain
in
comparison
with
cells
from
normal
individuals
cells
from
cf
and
normal
individuals
were
plated
at
low
density
and
exposed
to
ouabain
at
different
concentrations
for
hr
dose
response
curves
showed
that
cf
cells
survived
significantly
better
than
did
normal

at
all
ouabain

mm
survival
of
the
cf
cells
exposed
to
ouabain
was
decreased
to
that
of
the
normal
cells
if
the
glucose
concentration
of
the
potassium

was
decreased
to

the

disappeared
and
their
survival
was
identical
to
that

these
findings
may
be
useful
in
