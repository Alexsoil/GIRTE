the

on
the
occurrence

b
cells
and
thymus
derived
lymphocytes
t
cells
in
peripheral
blood
have
been
studied
in
groups
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
one
group
patients
suffered
from
chronic
ps
aeruginosa
infection
in
the
respiratory
tract
and
produced
multiple
ps
aeruginosa
precipitins
which
were
demonstrated
by
means
of
crossed
immunoelectrophoresis
the
other
group
patients
had
never
harboured
ps
aeruginosa
in
the
respiratory
tract
and
presented
no
demonstrable
precipitins
against
this
bacteria
the
lymphocytes
were
examined
for
the
presence
of
surface
markers
for
b
cells
receptor
for

for

the
b
t
cell
ratio
was
nearly
identical
in
the
groups
of
patients
whereas
the
total
numbers
of
b
and
t
cells
were
significant
higher
in
patients
with
chronic
ps

infection
the
number
of
ps
aeruginosa
precipitins
per
serum
was
significantly
positively
correlated
to
the
total
number
of
t
cells
wheras
the
correlation
with
the
total
number
of
b
cells
was
insignificant
