complement
activation
and
pulmonary
inflammation
in
cf
patients
this
study
examined
whether
biologic
activation
of
c
with
subsequent
pulmonary
inflammation
takes
place
in
the
lungs
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
plasma
complement
c
levels
were
all
normal
eleven
of
the
patients
with
the
c
split
product
c
c
were
from
the
group
of
patients
suffering
from
chronic
infection
with
mucoid
strains
of
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
and
were
from
the
group
of
cf
patients
without
p
aeruginosa
infection
this
difference
was
significant
p
a
comparison
of
albumin
ratios
between
the
patients
with
the
c
split
product
c
c
and
the
remaining
other
patients
showed
a
significant
higher
ratio
in
the
former
group
p
on
an
average
versus
per
cent
the
significantly
higher
albumin
ratio
demonstrated
in
the
patients
with
c
c
in
their
sputum
sol
phase
supports
the
concept
of
complement
induced
inflammation
with
subsequent
transudation
of
plasma
proteins
in
these
patients
this
study
thus
shows
that
complement
mediated
inflammatory
reactions
may
play
an
important
role
in
the
pathogenesis
of
pulmonary
tissue
damage
in
patients
with
cf
even
when
the
plasma
c
levels
are
normal
and
it
supports
the
concept
of
chronic
p
aeruginosa
lung
infection
as
an
immune
complex
disease
in
cf
patients
