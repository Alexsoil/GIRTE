prediction
of
tetracycline
induced
tooth
discoloration
forty
six
deciduous
teeth
from
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
who
had
a
recorded
history
of
tetracycline
therapy
were
sectioned
vertically
and
horizontally
teeth
in
three
representative
staining
categories
mild
moderate
and
severe
were
photographed
under
visible
and
ultraviolet
illumination
to
determine
the
extent
of
tetracycline
incorporation
into
tooth
enamel
and
dentin
tetracycline
incorporation
into
enamel
was
minimal
or
nonexistent
whereas
tetracycline
incorporation
into
dentin
was
always
observed
the
severity
of
general
surface
discoloration
was
directly
related
to
the
proximity
of
the
tetracycline
incorporation
to
the
dentinoenamel
junction
this
was
dependent
on
dosage
duration
and
period
of
initiation
of
tetracycline
therapy
as
it
related
to
odontogenesis
critical
periods
to
avoid
tetracycline
therapy
and
thereby
to
minimize
potential
tooth
discoloration
were
determined
