cystic
fibrosis
leakage
of
lysosomal
enzymes
and
of
alkaline
phosphatase
into
the
extracellular
space
nine
lysomal
enzymes
and
alkaline
phosphatase
have
been
assayed
with
two
different
ultramicro
techniques
in
the
intra
and
extracellular
space
of
fibroblast
cultures
derived
from
the
skin
of
cystic
fibrosis
patients
cystic
fibrosis
carriers
and
normals
controls
respectively
evidence
has
been
obtained
for
a
multiple
leakage
of
lysomal
enzymes
and
of
alkaline
phosphatase
into
the
medium
of
fibroblast
cultures
from
cystic
fibrosis
patients
and
carriers
the
situation
is
comparable
to
a
certain
extent
to
that
observed
in
i
cell
disease
mucolipidosis
ii
this
multiple
leakage
results
in
the
decrease
of
intracellular
activity
of
several
lysosomal
enzymes
in
cultures
from
cystic
fibrosis
patients
and
carriers
and
due
to
the
coordinate
regulationof
the
synthesis
of
the
leaky
enzymes
in
an
overshooting
of
the
intracellular
alkaline
phosphatase
activity
in
cultures
from
cystic
fibrosis
patients
it
also
explains
the
retarded
catabolism
of
certain
molecules
such
as
the
tamm
horsfall
glycoprotein
in
cystic
fibrosis
cells
it
is
speculated
that
the
basic
defect
in
cystic
fibrosis
leads
to
abnormal
recognition
sites
on
lysosomal
enzymes
and
on
alkaline
phosphatase
and
in
consequence
to
the
leakage
of
those
enzymes
into
the
extracellular
space
the
present
findings
allow
one
to
develop
methods
for
the
pre
and
postnatal
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
with
cell
cultures
and
for
the
detection
of
cystic
fibrosis
carriers
with
the
peripheral
blood
