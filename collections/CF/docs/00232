alpha
antitrypsin
in
duodenal
fluid

gallbladder
bile
using
the
immunoelectrophoretic
method
alpha
antitrypsin
was
detected
in
all

of
samples
of
duodenal
fluid
obtained
from
patients
with
various
gastroenterological
problems
the
concentrations

of
alpha
antitrypsin
in
duodenal
aspirates
from
children
with

less
than

from
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
shwachman

p
smaller
than
alpha
antitrypsin
was
detected
in
all

one
of
samples
of
gallbladder

the
exception
being
that
from
a
patient
with
extrahepatic
biliary
atresia
no

correlation
was
found
between

studied

activity
