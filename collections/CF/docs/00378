effect
of
gestational
length
on
albumin
content
of
meconium
during
a
screening
programme
for
the
detection
of
cf
using
the
meconium
albumin
technique
the
overall
false
positive
rate
was
found
to
be
approximately
when
the
gestational
age
of
the
infants
was
taken
into
account
the
false
positive
rate
was
found
to
be
significantly
higher
in
preterm
as
compared
to
term
infants
this
was
due
largely
but
not
solely
to
the
presence
of
occult
blood
possible
explanations
for
these
findings
are
discussed
and
attention
drawn
to
the
limitation
of
meconium
albumin
content
as
a
screening
technique
for
cf
in
preterm
infants
