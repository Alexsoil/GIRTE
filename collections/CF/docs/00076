problems
affecting
the
community
population
screening
screening
an
apparently
healthy
population
for
metabolic
disorders
raises
many
ethical
problems
it
is
necessary
to
differentiate
clearly
between
screening
programmes
of
a
service
nature
and
those
which
are
really
research
projects
screening
for
phenylketonuria
histidinaemia
galactosaemia
cystic
fibrosis
tay
and
sachs
disease
are
discussed
these
disorders
demonstrate
some
of
the
advantages
and
undoubtedly
difficult
problems
which
screening
presents
it
is
essential
that
no
one
should
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
the
aim
of
screening
is
to
help
the
individual
and
the
community
the
psychological
aspects
of
screening
are
very
important
and
continuing
thought
must
be
given
to
the
fact
that
biochemical
abnormalities
do
not
necessarily
equate
with
disease
