membrane
function
was
examined
in
cultured
cells
from
cystic
fibrosis
patients
by
assaying
several
enzymes
on
intact
skin
fibroblasts
attached
to
culture
dishes
this
technique
required
few
cells
and
minimized
disruption
of
cellular
organization
comparison
of
enzyme
activities
of
intact
and
broken
cells
showed
that
of
total
glucose
phosphate
dehydrogenase
a
cytoplasmic
enzyme
was
measurable
using
intact
cells
while
all
adenosine
monophosphatase
was
measurable
using
intact
cells
alkaline
paranitrophenylphosphatase
activity
was
divided
between
the
cell
surface
and
interior
substrate
competition
experiments
indicated
that
substrate
specificities
for
adenosine
monophosphatase
and
paranitrophenylphosphatase
activities
were
different
adenosine
monophosphatase
activities
of
control
and
cystic
fibrosis
strains
fluctuated
similarly
during
the
cell
culture
cycle
the
apparent
km
values
relative
to
adenosine
monophosphate
were
similar
in
all
strains
a
chromatographic
fraction
of
serum
from
a
cystic

patient
that
was
inhibitory
to
oyster
ciliary
activity
had
no
effect
on
adenosine
monophosphatase
activity
of
normal
fibroblasts
furthermore
fractions
of
media
from
cystic
fibrosis
homozygote
and
heterozygote
fibroblast
cultures
were
not
inhibitory
to
adenosine
monophosphatase
activities
of
intact
normal
fibroblasts
or
of
part
iculate
fractions
prepared
from
them
in
light
of
previous
studies
that
showed
that
factors
from
cystic
fibrosis
serum
of
culture
medium
disrupted
specific
membrane
activities
it
is
proposed
that
the
cystic
fibrosis
factor
interacts
with
the
plasma
membrane
interfering
most
conspicuously
with
the
protein
functions
that
are
sensitive
to
changes
in
their
membrane
environment
