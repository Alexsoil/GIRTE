chronic
diarrhea
in
childhood
a
new
look
at
an
old
problem
diarrhea
can
be
defined
as
excess
loss
of
water
and
electrolytes
in
feces
but
what
is
an
excess
to
the
physician
fecal
losses
may
be
excessive
when
they
cause
the
patient
to
be
ill
to
a
parent
a
stool
pattern
that
differs
from
that
of
a
neighbor
s
infant
or
even
a
single
watery
stool
may
be
too
much
new
knowledge
of
normal
gut
function
and
the
pathologic
processes
that
may
afflict
the
child
s
alimentary
tract
has
improved
one
capability
to
diagnose
and
manage
certain
specific
diseases
that
cause
diarrhea
although
of
great
interest
to
academicians
many
of
these
diseases
are
extraordinarily
rare
and
in
most
practices
there
is
a
substantial
and
perplexing
pool
of
poopers
in
whom
no
specific
disease
can
be
found
fortunately
patients
in
this
latter
group
are
rarely
seriously
ill
this
article
attempts
to
help
the
practitioner
understand
diagnose
and
treat
children
with
specific
diseases
known
to
cause
chronic
diarrhea
we
will
speculate
also
on
the
mechanisms
and
management
of
idiopathic
chronic
diarrhea
