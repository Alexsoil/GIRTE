changes
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
simultaneous
red
blood
cell
rbc
and
plasma
volume
determinations
were
obtained
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
and
moderately
severe
pulmonary
involvement
hypervolemia
with
an
increase
in
both
rbc
and
plasma
volumes
was
observed
changes
in
blood
volume
were
marked
when
values
were
indexed
by
weight
but
less
significant
when
indexed
by
height
decreasing
systemic
arterial
oxygen
saturation
was
associated
with
a
progressive
increase
in
rbc
mass
hematocrit
value
and
hemoglobin
level
and
a
decrease
in
mean
corpuscular
hemoglobin
concentration
rbc
and
total
blood
volumes
were
highest
in
patients
with
cor
pulmonale
and
congestive
heart
failure
however
the
compensatory
polycythemic
response
in
patients
with
cf
was
inadequate
when
compared
with
the
response
to
hypoxemia
in
patients
with
cyanotic
congenital
heart
disease
the
insufficient
oxygen
carrying
capacity
may
compromise
tissue

and
necessitate
treatment
