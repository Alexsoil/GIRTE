effects
of
gravity
on
tracheal

transport
rates
in
normal
subjects
and
in

with
cystic
fibrosis
a
noninvasive
radionuclide
imaging
technique
for
measuring
the
rate
of
mucus
clearance
in
the
trachea
rt
was
used
to
study
gravitational
effects
on
mucus
clearance
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
average
age
years
normal
nonsmoking
adults
average
age
years
and
a
normal
subject
who
was
recovering
from
an
acute
upper
respiratory
tract
infection
urti
in
the
upright
position
nine
of
the
cf
patients
and
the
subject
with
urti
demonstrated
abnormal
tracheal
mucus
clearance
which
approached
normal
when
they
were
placed
in
degrees
headdown
position
the
normal
subjects
and
two
of
the
cf
patients
showed
no
significant
difference
in
the
rt
measured
in
the
two
positions
the
results
of
the
study
indicate
that
the
force
of
gravity
can
be
a
major
influence
on
tracheal
mucus
clearance
in
cf
and
urti
subjects
this
conclusion
supports
the
use
of
postural
drainage
as
an
effective
form
of
therapy
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
