urinary
excretion
of
adenosine
monophosphate
and

monophosphate
in
normal
children
and
those
with
cystic

the
urinary
excretion
of
adenosine
monophosphate
cyclic
amp
and
guanosine
monophosphate
cyclic
gmp
was
examined
in
normal
children
and
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
between
the
ages
of
months
and
yr
diurnal
variations
in
cyclic
amp
and
cyclic
gmp
excretion
were
observed
in
subjects
from
either
group
and
peak
levels
of
cyclic
nucleotide
excretion
were
generally
observed
during
the
period
of
to
h
excretion
rates
mumol
day
of
cyclic
amp
and
cyclic
gmp
increased
significantly
with
age
when
cyclic
amp
and
cyclic
gmp
excretion
rates
were
normalized
for
urinary
creatine
or
body
weight
the
values
declined
significantly
with
age
in
both
groups
of
patients
cyclic
gmp
excretion
normalized
for
body
surface
area
also
decreased
with
age
while
the
value
for
cyclic
amp
plus

minus
mumol
day
m
mean
plus
or
minus
se
was
constant
with
age
in
both
normals
and
cystic
fibrosis
children
with
some
comparisons
of
age
groups
there
were
significant
differences
in
cyclic
nucleotide
excretion
between
normal
subjects
and
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
differences
noted
were
dependent
upon
the
methods
used
to
normalize
excretion
rates
urinary
creatine
body
weight
surface
area
and
the
ratio
of
cyclic
amp
to
cyclic
gmp
excreted
in
general
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
excreted
greater
amounts
of
cyclic
gmp
than
did
normals
the
most
striking
comparison
was
the
ratio
of
cyclic
amp
to
cyclic
gmp
excreted
which
was

all
