theories
of
genetic
causation
in
human
disease
the
central
problem
of
the
mid
th
century
genetic
counselor
has
been
to
determine
the
place
of
the
genes
in
the
origin
of
complex
human
characteristics
such
as
neural
tube
defects
cleft
palate
diabetes
and
congenital
heart
disease
in
short
the
major
malformation
and
polygenic
syndromes
which
make
up
the
bulk
of
what
we
call
birth
defects
of
comparable
importance
in
terms
of
genetic
counseling
is
understanding
the
origin
and
incidence
of
the
newly
recognized
genetic
heterogeneity
lying
behind
what
had
previously
been
regarded
as
simple
single
gene
determined
diseases
topics
include
dealing
with
genetic
heterogeneity
phenotypes
and
genotypes
where
genetic
causation
defies
simple
analysis
and
sources
of
variation
behavior
disorders
with
presumptive
single
gene
causation
lesch
nyhan
disease
presumptive
sex
linked
causation
aggressivity
and
presumptive
polygenic
causation
alcoholism
are
also
discussed
