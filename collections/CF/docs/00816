reduction
of
bile
acid
loss
in
cystic
fibrosis
by
dietary
means
on
a
normal
diet
increased
faecal
bile
acid
excretion
was
found
in
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
who
had
steatorrhoea
but
excretion
was
normal
in
such
children
without
steatorrhoea
the
children
with
steatorrhoea
took
regimens
of
diet
and
therapy
a
normal
diet
with
pancreatic
enzyme
supplements
a
diet
of
reduced
long
chain
triglycerides
with
added
medium
chain
triglycerides
and
the
same
diet
with
added
pancreatic
enzyme
supplements
on
each
of
these
three
regimens
steatorrhoea
and
faecal
bile
acid
loss
were
significantly
less
than
on
no
treatment
with
the
lowest
excretions
occurring
on
the
diet
of
reduced
long
chain
triglycerides
with
added
medium
chain
triglycerides
and
pancreatic
enzyme
supplements
although
a
reduction
in
steatorrhoea
was
nearly
always
accompanied
by
a
decrease
in
bile
acid
excretion
the
initial
bile
acid
loss
was
very
variable
and
could
not
be
predicted
for
any
given
degree
of
steatorrhoea
this
suggests
that
at
least
one
other
factor
possibly
liver
disease
or
bile
acid
pool
size
influences
bile
acid
loss
in
the
faeces
