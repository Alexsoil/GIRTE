screening
for
cystic
fibrosis
in
the
newborn
in
an
year
period
a
programme
of
screening
for
cystic
fibrosis
has
been
conducted
over
an
extensive
part
of
wales
the
screening
method
used
is
based
on
the
detection
of
a
high
level
of
albumen
greater
than
mg
in
the
meconium
during
the
course
of
the
investigations
several
different
tests
have
been
used
because
of
the
high
incidence
of
false
negative
results
the
detection
of
protein
in
meconium
is
not
an
ideal
screening
test
but
is
the
most
satisfactory
presently
available
in
the
newborn
period
because
of
its
relative
simplicity
low
cost
absence
of
direct
involvement
of
the
parent
or
patient
and
a
high
yield
of
positive
cases
its
use
on
a
wider
scale
may
be
justified
