serotyping
of
mucoid
strains
isolated
from
cystic
fibrosis
patients
was
carried
out
by
slide
agglutination
tests
with
both
live
and
heat
killed
cells
and
by
tube
agglutination
test
with
heat
killed
cells
comparison
of
the
results
obtained
by
these
methods
revealed
that
tube
agglutination
with
heat
killed
cells
was
the
superior
method
more
than

were
