cirrhosis
of
the
liver
in
infancy
and
early
childhood
is
not
a
common
phenomenon
however
because
of
the
attendant
morbidity
and
frequent
mortality
it
represents
a
significant
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
problem
in
this
age
group
this
review
will
present
briefly
the
metabolic
cirrhoses
of
infancy
discuss
currently
proposed
pathogenetic
mechanisms
and
outline
diagnostic
techniques
that
may
aid
the
pathologist
in
his
approach
to
the
problem
