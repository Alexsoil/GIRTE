cystic
fibrosis
and
hearing
loss
the
mucosal
epithelium
of
the
middle
ear
and
eustachian
tube
is
in
direct
continuity
with
the
upper
respiratory
tract
since
the
otolaryngological
aspects
of
cystic
fibrosis
cf
are
dominated
by
involvement
of
the
paranasal
sinuses
it
might
be
assumed
that
children
with
cf
would
be
expected
to
have
a
higher
than
usual
incidence
of
middle
ear
disease
eighty
patients
who
were
afflicted
with
cf
had
audiological
evaluations
which
consisted
of
hearing
threshold
levels
to
hz
and
speech
and
impedance
audiometry
we
found
no
greater
incidence
of
a
conductive
or
sensorineural
hearing
loss
in
patients
with
cf
when
compared
with
a
normal
age
adjusted
population
