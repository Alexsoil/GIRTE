alkaline
phosphatase
induction

fibroblasts
letter
hosli
has
published
a
hypothesis
relating
to
the
primary
cause
of
cystic
fibrosis
cf
based
on
his
observations
that
the
level
of
alkaline
phosphatase
alp
in
cf
derived
skin
fibroblasts
but
not
fibroblasts
derived
from
normal
individuals
could
be
increased
several
fold
by
growing
the
cells
in
the
presence
of
the
urinary
glycoprotein
tamm
horsfall
protein
thp
however
we
have
not
been
able
to
show
in
adelaide
any
change
or
induction
in
the
level
of
alp
activity
in
cf
derived
skin
fibroblasts
when
grown
in
the
presence
of
locally
prepared
thp
under
what
appear
to
be
identical
cell
culture
conditions
to
those
used
by
hosli
it
thus
appears
that
under
the
conditions
currently
employed
in
our
laboratory
there
is
no
diagnostic
discrimination
between
fibroblasts
of
cf
homozygotes
and
normal
individuals
