occult
appendiceal
abscess
complicating
cystic

three
case
histories
illustrate
the
diagnostic
dilemma
encountered
whenever
a
patient
with
cf
who
is
receiving
antibiotics
is
evaluated
for
abdominal
pain
although
acute
appendicitis
with
perforation
and
abscess
formation
is
not
a
common
complication
of
cf
it
occurs
more
frequently
than
is
generally
appreciated
the
large
number
of
abdominal
situations
in
cf
which
can
cause
pain
confused
with
but
not
typical
of
acute
appendicitis
the
true
underlying
condition
is
further
masked
by
the
concurrent
use
of
antibiotics
for
pulmonary
infection
a
higher
index
of
suspicion
is
needed
to
rule
out
acute
appendicitis
in
a
patient
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
abdominal
pain
a
greater
awaremess
of
the
possibility
of
occult
appendiceal
abscess
may
help
to
avoid
this
complication
