case
reports
of
seven
infants
between
the
ages
of
to
months
who
developed
these
abnormalities
indicate
that
in
several
instances
the
children
s
condition
was
misdiagnosed
as
milk
sensitivity
or
milk
allergy
furthermore
their
case
histories
verify
that
their
hypoalbuminemia

is
nutritional

is
corrected

with

supplement
is

reports
