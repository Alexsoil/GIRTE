detection
of
cystic
fibrosis
with
plasma
hydrolases
letter
dr
hosli
and
mrs
hosli
reported
that
differential
thermolability
of
plasma
alpha
mannosidase
and
plasma
acid
phosphatase
allowed
discrimination
between
normal
people
cystic
fibrosis
carriers
and
patients
we
have
repeated
these
experiments
paying
special
attention
to
the
technical
details
given
in
the
hoslis
s
paper
in
a
separate
series
of
experiments
we
used
larger
volumes
of
plasma
for
each
assay
which
was
performed
either
with
or
without
non
fluorescent
paraffin
oil
in
both
cases
the
blood
samples
were
processed
exactly
as
outlined
in
hosli
and
vogt
s
paper
there
were
no
significant
differences
in
the
heat
stability
of
plasma
alpha
mannosidase
and
acid
phosphatase
between
the
three
groups
