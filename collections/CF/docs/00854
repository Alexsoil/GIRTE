liver
sialyltransferase
the
activity
of
sialytransferase
with
regard
to
the
glycoprotein
substrates
asialofetuin
and
asialo
ovine
submaxillary
mucin
was
determined
in
normal
pathological
control
and
cystic
fibrosis
liver
homogenates
cystic
fibrosis
and
pathological
livers
have
about
of
the
average
normal
specific
activity
for
sialytransferase
several
properties
of
cystic
fibrosis
sialytransferase
were
investigated
and
compared
to
those
of
the
normal
liver
enzyme
alhadeff
et
al
the
ph
optima
curves
were
similar
but
cystic
fibrosis
sialyltransferase
appears
to
be
more
thermolabile
than
the
normal
liver
enzyme
isoelectric
focusing
studies
revealed
that
the
three
most
basic
forms
of
sialyltransferase
which
are
found
in
normal
livers
are
deficient
or
absent
in
most
cystic
fibrosis
liver
the
data
suggest
that
altered
glycoprotein
sialyltransferases
may
be
present
in
cystic
fibrosis
livers
probably
a
secondary
effect
due
to
general
liver
pathology
