research
in
cystic
fibrosis
second
of
three
parts
tissue
culture
studies
involving
metachromasia
glycosaminoglycans
rna
methylation
cell
membranes
and
ciliatoxic
activity
in
medium
are
described
although
not
fulfilling
the
hopes
of
a
quick
route
to
discovery
of
the
basic
defect
in
this
disease
that
were
raised
by
the
first
findings
the
study
of
fibroblasts
in
cystic
fibrosis
has
given
important
information
the
evidence
at
present
indicates
that
lysosomes
and
probably
other
intracellular
organelles
are
normal
in
morphology
and
function
in
cystic
fibrosis
several
humoral
abnormalities
have
been
found
in
cystic
fibrosis
those
that
influence
ciliary
activity
in
experimental
models
those
that
affect
membrane
transport
and
the
abnormality
in
polyamine
distribution
a
number
of
abnormal
humoral
factors
have
been
found
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
limitations
in
their
interpretation
are
serious
the
assays
used
to
delineate
these
abnormalities
are
often
not
universally
reproducible
some
because
of
their
inherent
variability
and
others
because
they
are
technically
forbidding
therefore
unified
definition
of
the
so
called
cystic
fibrosis
factors
is
not
possible
at
present
