intestinal
mucins
in
health
and
disease
intestinal
mucins
are
complex
glycoproteins
which
are
secreted
from
goblet
cells
and
form
a
gel
like
covering
over
the
mucosal
surface
they
are
assumed
to
provide
lubrication
and
protection
of
the
underlying
epithelium
against
potentially
injurious
chemicals
enzymes
bacteria
and
dietary
constituents
recent
advances
in
our
understanding
of
mucin
structure
secretion
and
functional
properties
are
reviewed
in
this
paper
implications
for
diseases
such
as
cystic
fibrosis
peptic
ulcer
malignancy
and
inflammatory
bowel
disease
are
briefly
discussed
