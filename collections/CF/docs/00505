third
of
three
parts
recent
autonomic
nervous
system
studies
in
cystic
fibrosis
are
outlined
miscellaneous
observations
regarding
salivary
and
tear
glands
calcium
the
kallikrein
kinin
system
protease
inhibitor
alpha
fetoprotein
and
endocrine
glands
are
discussed
because
more
than
per
cent
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
die
of
progressive
pulmonary
involvement
complicated
by
infection
with
staphylococcus
aureus
or
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
or
both
the
question
of
immunologic
deficit
is
frequently
raised
extensive
investigations
have
shown
the
immune
system
in
cystic
fibrosis
to
be
intact
studies
regarding
pulmonary
ciliary
clearance
and
bacteriology
are
also
outlined
despite
extensive
investigations
the
basic
defect
of
cystic
fibrosis
is
still
unknown
what
then
is
the
explanation
of
the
two
defects
in
homozygotes
that
lead
to
most
clinical
manifestations
the
sweat
electrolyte
defect
and
the
abnormality
in
physiochemical
behavior
of
mucous
secretions
the
former
is
satisfactorily
explained
by
a
sodium
reabsorption
inhibitory
factor
present
in
sweat
and
saliva
of
patients
as
for
the
mucous
secretion
abnormality
the
effect
of
the
increasing
calcium
concentration
in
decreasing
the
solubility
of
glycoproteins
suggests
that
this
mechanism
might
be
responsible
for
the
precipitation
and
obstruction
of
organ
passages
which
gives
rise
to
most
symptoms
in
cystic
fibrosis
although
there
is
an
excellent
diagnostic
test
for
homozygotes
sweat
test
one
cannot
rely
on
any
of
the
present
biologic
assays
for
determination
of
heterozygosity
or
antenatal
diagnosis
