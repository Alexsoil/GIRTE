the
use
of
new
antibiotic
agents
for
chronic
pulmonary
disease
modern
advances
in
the
development
of
antimicrobial
agents
and
in
chemotherapy
have
made
available
potent
aminoglycoside
antibiotics
with
more
effective
ones
to
come
their
effectiveness
against
p
aeruginosa
is
a
great
contribution
to
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
other
chronic
disorders
the
development
of
carbenicillin
has
augmented
the
effectiveness
of
the
aminoglycoside
antibiotics
ticarcillin
is
similar
to
carbenicillin
and
will
play
a
similar
role
in
antibiotic
therapy
the
cephalosporins
serve
as
alternative
agents
principally
for
their
antistaphylococcal
activity
we
are
urgently
in
need
of
a
potent
antibiotic
agent
against
p
aeruginosa
that
can
be
given
by
the
oral
route
the
tmp
smx
combination
is
a
potent
chemotherapeutic
agent
that
can
be
administered
by
the
oral
route
it
is
effective
in
the
treatment
of
p
carinii
pneumonia
which
is
very
common
owing
to
the
extended
survival
of
patients
with
leukemia
and
other
malignancies
or
with
allografts
who
are
prone
to
develop
infections
with
immunosuppressive
therapy
