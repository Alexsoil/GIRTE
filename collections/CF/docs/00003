a
clinical
study
of
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
by
instrumental
neutron
activation
analysis
of
sodium
in
nail
clippings
this
article
reports
on
the
possibility
of
using
instrumental
neutron
activation
analysis
inaa
of
sodium
in
nail
clippings
for
diagnosing
cystic
fibrosis
cf
in
children
and
adults
for
detecting
heterozygotes
and
for
screening
in
the
neonatal
period
nail
clippings
from
newborns
cf
patients
two
of
them
newborns
healthy
controls
and
heterozygotes
were
analyzed
the
discrimination
between
cf
patients
and
controls
was
found
to
be
precise
for
individuals
above
one
year
of
age
and
inaa
of
nail
clippings
should
be
accepted
as
a
diagnostic
test
for
cf
after
this
age
heterozygotes
could
not
be
detected
by
the
method
during
the
first
five
days
of
life
there
is
a
big
overlap
between
the
values
from
normal
newborns
and
those
of
cf
children
which
makes
the
method
invaluable
for
early
screening
for
cf
