freshly

in

in

the
blood
from

heterozygotes
of
c

was
assayed
the
mean
c

in
the
c

men
was
slightly
lower

in
the
male
controls

the
c

had
a
significantly
higher

of

the

the

this

significant
comparison
of

from
all
of
the

shows
considerable
overlap
in

in

these

suggest
that
an
assay
of

c
does
not
effectively
distinguish
c

with
other
types

chronic

disease
however
the
differences
between
c

women

c

men
is
interesting
and
deserves
further
attention
our
data
from
c

young

do
not
fully
confirm
those
reported
by

it
is
possible
that
the
experimental
effects
of

by

might

from
