carboxypeptidase
a
activity
of
cultured
skin
fibroblasts
and
relationship
to
cystic
fibrosis
properties
of
carboxypeptidase
a
of
cultured
skin
fibroblasts
from
control
and
cystic
fibrosis
patients
were
studied
using
alpha
n
carbobenzoxy
l
glutamyl
l
tyrosine
as
substrate
carboxypeptidase
a
was
inhibited
by
thiomersal
cyanide
iodoacetate
and
n
ethylmaleimide
in
a
similar
manner
for
control
and
cystic
fibrosis
fibroblasts
both
trypsin
and
dithiothreitol
treatment
activated
the
enzyme
but
phenanthroline
inhibited
only
in
the
presence
of
dithiothreitol
both
zn
and
co
reversed
this
inhibition
trypsin
treatment
of
carboxypeptidase
a
produced
a
form
of
the
enzyme
having
a
higher
km
value
for
both
control
and
cystic
fibrosis
fibroblasts
dithiothreitol
treatment
of
control
fibroblasts
resulted
in
a
form
with
similar
properties
to
the
trypsin
activated
form
but
cystic
fibrosis
fibroblasts
yielded
a
variant
form
with
even
higher
km
and
vmax
values
since
other
properties
were
similar
it
seems
likely
that
this
difference
reflected
binding
of
a
molecule
to
the
enzyme
rather
than
of
a
defect
in
the
enzyme
