impaired
oxygen
supply
and
deteriorating
health
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
correlates
with
abnormal
changes
in
the
fatty
acid
composition
of
blood
lipids
as
the
proportion
of
oleates
increases
and
that
of
linoleates
decreases
erythrocyte
membrane
interference
with
the
formation
of
intracellular
oxyhemoglobin
increases
and
arterial
oxygen
pressure
decreases
the
physical
chemical
basis
for
these
changes
seems
to
be
that
oleic
and
linoleic
acid
differ
in
their
ability
to
undergo
reversible
oxygenation
in
response
to
changes
in
oxygen
pressure
the
oxygen
complex
of
linoleic
acid
dissociates
at
relatively
high
pressures
whereas
that
of
oleic
dissociates
only
at
low
pressures
accordingly
excessive
substitution
of
oleic
for
linoleic
acid
in
membrane
lipids
would
be
expected
to
decrease
the
intracellular
oxygen
pressure
to
a
level
where
hemoglobin
oxygenation
and
any
other
oxygen
requiring
processes
would
be
impaired
