the
effects
of
an
artificial
diet
on
growth
were
examined
in
a
controlled
trial
on
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
patients
received
the
diet
for
months
comparison
was
made
between
their
growth
before
during
and
after
dietary
treatment
growth
changes
were
also
assessed
in
other
patients
who
received
a
conventional
diet
artificial
dietary
treatment
led
to
some
improvement
in
height
weight
subscapular
skinfold
thickness
and
a
disproportionate
advance
of
bone
age
for
the
group
as
a
whole
only
patients

a
clinically
significant
improvement
in

standard

score
greatest
improvements
were
in
young
and
mildly
affected
patients
it
is
proposed
that
the
future
use
of
such
an
unpleasant
and
expensive
diet
should
be
restricted
to
a
few
selected
cases
rather
than
given
as
routine
treatment
