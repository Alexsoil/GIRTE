diagnosing

state
that
cystic
fibrosis
may
be
first
diagnosed
in
adulthood
but
we
feel
that
a
condition
with
such
grave
genetic
and
prognostic
implications
must
be
diagnosed
with
special
caution
in
this
age
group
in
particular
the
sweat
test
which
is
the
main
diagnostic
tool
for
use
with
children
must
be
interpreted
in
adults
in
the
light
of
possible
age
related
increases
in
normal
sweat
electrolyte
concentration
and
other
factors
that
may
affect
the
assay
although
it
is
generally
accepted
that
normal
sweat
sodium
and
chloride
concentrations
are
higher
in
adults
than
in
children
there
is
no
clear
agreement
about
the
upper
limits
of
the
normal
range
in
adults
the
volume
of
sweat
produced
during
the
test
may
also
have
a
substantial
effect
on
electrolyte
values
for
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
adults
an
attempt
should
thus
be
made
to
base
the
diagnosis
not
only
on
elevated
sweat
electrolyte
values
and
clinical
impression
but
also
on
pancreatic
function
data
