a
study
of
the
salivary
glycoprotein
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
and
controls
fucose
incorporation
and
protein
pattern
the
incorporation
of
fucose
to
glycoprotein
acceptors
prepared
from
the
saliva
of
cystic
fibrosis
cf
patients
was
compared
with
the
incorporation
into
acceptors
from
controls
the
cf
acceptor
glycoprotein
incorporated
significantly
more
fucose
in
the
presence
of
either
patients
or
control
plasma
the
fucosyl
transferase
activity
in
the
patients
plasma
was
not
significantly
different
from
controls
fucosidase
activity
was
similar
also
for
both
groups
the
protein
bands
of
the
acceptor
glycoproteins
from
the
patients
saliva
differed
from
those
of
the
control
in
number
and
electrophoretic
mobility
on
the
basis
of
these
studies
of
fucose
incorporation
we
propose
that
glycoprotein
in
the
salivary
secretion
of
e
apatients
are
qualitatively
different
from
normal
