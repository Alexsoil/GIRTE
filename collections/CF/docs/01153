the
mechanism
of
autogenic
drainage
studied
with
flow
volume
curves
in
we
demonstrated
the
efficiency
of
autogenic
drainage
with
two
bronchorrheic
children
who
needed
bronchography
for
diagnostic
purposes
this
demonstration
was
made
possible
thanks
to
a
radiocinematographic
study
after
bronchography
the
examination
also
showed
the
inefficacy
of
coughing
the
object
of
the
present
study
is
to
analyze
the
physiologic
mechanism
of
autogenic
drainage
for
children
older
than
five
this
method
is
very
simple
and
efficient
and
as
the
effort
or
onset
is
not
excessive
and
as
expiration
does
not
need
to
be
complete
autogenic
drainage
is
not
exhausting
and
can
be
performed
for
a
long
time
which
is
indispensable
since
the
progression
of
secretions
is
slow
