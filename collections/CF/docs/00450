care
of
children
with
conditions
characterized
by
high
nutritional
risks
a
key
to
any
successful
preventive
nutritional
program
is
long
term
follow
up
reinforcement
and
early
intervention
when
necessary
the

careful
monitoring
of
various
parameters
of
growth
such
as
length
weight
head
circumference
and
skinfold

it
is
essential

limitations
and
complications
of
any

we
have
described
only
three
examples
of
complex
nutritional
problems
encountered
in
the

are
many
more
equally
challenging
and
frustrating
medical
and
surgical
disorders
which
demand
the
expertise
of
the
dietitian
for
successful
management
the
dietitian
of
the
future
cannot
rely
on
knowledge
alone
but
must
utilize
considerable
ingenuity
and
creativity
in
managing
these
complicated
nutritional
enigmas
