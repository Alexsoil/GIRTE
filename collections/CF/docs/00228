fumigatus
and
common
allergens
immunological
studies
of
forty
three
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
showed
that
positive
prick
tests
to
at
least
one
common
allergen
were
obtained
in
to
multiple
allergens
in
and
to
a
fumigatus
in
specific
ige
antibodies
against
these
allergens
were
found
in
the
appropriate
subjects
in
spite
of
this
evidence
of
type
ige
sensitization
none
of
the
patients
had
a
history
of
infantile
eczema
intracutaneous
tests
with
a
fumigatus
extract
gave
types
and
reactions
in
sixteen
patients
only
seven
of
whom
were
among
the
sixteen
who
gave
positive
precipitin
tests
raised
levels
of
total

igg

were
found
as
compared
with
healthy
controls
and
asthmatic
subjects
no

were
found
in

the
high

of

to
a

is
confirmed
