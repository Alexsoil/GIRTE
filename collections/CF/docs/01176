an
evaluation
of
the
meconium
lactase
test
for
the
detection
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
the
newborn
recently
antonowicz
et
al
proposed
a
simple
test
for
cystic
fibrosis
that
could
be
used
to
verify
the
boehringer
mannheim
meconium
test
result
and
thus
reduce
the
false
positive
incidence
the
test
is
based
on
the
detection
of
lactase
activity
in
meconium
the
lactase
test
may
be
of
some
value
as
a
confirmatory
test
when
used
with
the
bm
mec
test
although
its
specificity
in
this
study
was
not
as
good
as
previously
reported
