precipitating
antibodies
against
e
coli
b
fragilis
and
p
aeruginosa
in
cf
patients
and
normal
persons
determined
by
means
of
crossed
immunoelectrophoresis
wallwork
and
co
workers
have
proposed
that
increased
absorption
of
antigens
takes
place
across
the
mucosal
membranes
of
the
gut
and
respiratory
tract
possibly
due
to
a
transient
defect
in
the
production
of
secretory
iga
as
a
consequence
of
this
hypothesis
one
would
expect
cystic
fibrosis
patients
to
produce
a
pronounced
antibody
response
against
the
intestinal
bacterial
flora
the
present
work
was
therefore
carried
out
to
investigate
the
antibody
response
in
cf
patients
and
in
normal
persons
against
escherichia
coli
and
bacteroides
fragilis
which
are
present
in
the
gut
in
large
numbers
and
against
the
respiratory
pathogen
p
aeruginosa
a
significantly
higher
prevalence
of
precipitins
against
each
of
the
bacterial
species
was
found
in
cf
patients
compared
to
normal
persons
and
the
prevalence
of
precipitins
against
each
of
these
bacteria
increased
significantly
with
age
as
regards
p
aeruginosa
precipitins
the
prevalence
and
number
was
significantly
higher
in
cf
patients
who
have
subsequently
succumbed
compared
to
cf
patients
who
are
still
alive
such
a
correlation
between
the
antibody
response
and
the
prognosis
of
the
patients
was
not
found
as
regards
e
coli
or
b
fragilis
considering
the
hypothesis
of
wallwork
and
co
workers
concerning
increased
absorption
of
antigens
from
the
gut
it
seems
more
attractive
to
suppose
that
increased
absorption
of
antigens
from
the
gut
flora
occurs
predominantly
in
cf
patients
with
p
aeruginosa
lung
infection
with
a
pronounced
antibody
response
against
p
aeruginosa
