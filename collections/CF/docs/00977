cystic

and
hla
in
children
suffering
from
cystic
fibrosis
no
abnormal
frequencies
of
hla
markers
of
the
a
and
b
locus
were
observed
in
comparison
with
the
distribution
of
these
antigens
in
control
series
furthermore
the
hla
genotypes
of
seven
pairs
of
diseased
sibs
are
incompatible
with
the
hypothesis
of
a
closed
linkage
between
cf
an
autosomal
recessive
transmitted
disease
and
hla
