prolactin
growth
hormone
and
alpha
fetoprotein
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
prolactin
is
credited
to
have
a
role
in
the
maintenance
of
electrolytic
and
water
balance
by
the
kidneys
although
its
effect
on
the
composition
of
sweat
is
unknown
we
assayed
prolactin
growth
hormone
and
alpha
fetoprotein
in
the
sera
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
attending
the
hospital
for
sick
children
sera
from
children
without
cystic
fibrosis
were
used
as
control
it
appears
that
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
have
serum
levels
of
prolactin
gh
and
alpha
fp
similar
to
those
without
this
disease
and
that
children
have
significantly
higher
levels
of
alpha
fp
than
women
of
reproductive
age
