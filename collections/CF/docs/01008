radioimmunoassay
of
trypsin
a
new
aid
in
the
assessment
of
pancreatic
function
this
review
describes
the
development
and
application
of
a
novel
test
to
determine
levels
of
human
immunoreactive
trypsin
an
enzyme
produced
solely
by
the
pancreas
in
biological
fluids
being
organ
specific
the
assay
of
immunoreactive
trypsin
should
be
an
ideal
marker
of
pancreatic
function
and
this
is
supported
by
the
results
of
a
number
of
clinical
and
research
investigations
use
of
this
assay
in
studies
of
chronic
pancreatitis
juvenile
onset
diabetes
and
cystic
fibrosis
has
yielded
much
valuable
data
and
it
is
expected
that
further
research
will
lead
to
an
improved
understanding
of
these
and
other
conditions
associated
with
the
pancreas
in
health
and
disease
