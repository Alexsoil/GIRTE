steatorrhea
is
a
prevalent
gastrointestinal
manifestation
of
cystic
fibrosis
although
deficiencies
of
vitamins
a
e
and
k
have
been
described
in
patients
with
this
disease
vitamin
d
deficiency
and
rickets
have
rarely
been
reported
the
major
form
of
vitamin
d
cholecalciferol
vitamin
d
is
produced
by
ultraviolet
irradiation
of
dehydrocholesterol
in
the
skin
ergocalciferol
vitamin
d
is
a
product
of
plant
ergosterol
we
studied
the
vitamin
d
status
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
by
measurement
of
the
serum
concentrations
of
the
major
circulating
metabolites
of
vitamin
d
hydroxyvitamin
d
and
dihydroxyvitamin
d
the
mean
serum
concentrations
of
total
ohd
ohd
and
oh
d
and
ohd
ohd
ratios
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
were
similar
to
values
recorded
in
control
subjects
the
present
study
demonstrates
that
the
serum
concentrations
of
the
major
metabolites
of
vitamin
d
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
are
similar
to
those
in
healthy
subjects
