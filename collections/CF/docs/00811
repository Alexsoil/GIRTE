limitations
of
the
sweat
test
letter
we
are
in
agreement
with
schwarz
et
al
when
they
state
that
the
sweat
test
has
some
limitations
in
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
cf
and
that
the
diagnosis
is
not
justified
on
the
basis
of
an
abnormal
sweat
test
unless
there
is
other
supporting
evidence
of
the
disease
in
our
experience
a
much
greater
problem
of
sweat
test
accuracy
occurs
in
hospitals
where
the
test
is
carried
out
on
a
very
much
smaller
number
of
patients
and
where
the
laboratory
has
a
much
lesser
degree
of
experience
than
that
of
the
authors
we
have
had
a
significant
number
of
patients
referred
to
our
regional
children
s
hospital
who
have
had
abnormal
sweat
electrolyte
measurements
elsewhere
but
unequivocally
normal
measurements
when
repeated
by
a
laboratory
carrying
out
a
large
number
of
tests
we
have
not
needed
to
go
to
the
extent
of
serial
collections
of
sweat
and
of
giving
spironolactone
as
have
the
authors
if
we
obtain
a
test
within
the
grey
area
on
repeated
occasions
we
carefully
seek
other
evidence
of
the
disease
particularly
evidence
of
pancreatic
disease
we
do
not
advocate
the
general
use
of
spironolactone
the
merit
of
this
drug
in
our
experiments
on
certain
patients
was
merely
to
support
our
suspicion
of
temporary
hyperaldosteronism
a
condition
which
might
have
led
to
erroneous
conclusions
in
the
absence
of
k
or
cl
determinations
