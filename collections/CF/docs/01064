study
of
the
oligosaccharide
units
from
mucus
glycoproteins
of
meconium
from
normal
infants
and
from
cases
of
cystic
fibrosis
with
meconium
ileus
the
mucus
glycoproteins
in
meconium
from
normal
infants
and
from
infants
having
cystic
fibrosis
with
meconium
ileus
have
been
studied
whereas
normal
meconium
contained
about
protein
bound
carbohydrate
the
meconium
from
cystic
fibrosis
contained
only
about
glycopolypeptides
were
prepared
from
the
mucus
of
glycoproteins
the
oligosaccharide
units
from
this
material
were
released
and
fractionated
the
fractions
ranged
widely
in
size
and
composition
the
fractions
from
cystic
fibrosis
specimens
had
a
significantly
higher
content
of
fucose
than
those
from
normal
specimens
