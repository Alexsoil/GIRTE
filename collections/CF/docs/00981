rusters
the
corrosive
action
of
palmar
sweat
i
sodium
chloride
in
sweat
sweat
from
rusters
and
control
persons
was
examined
for
its
sodium
concentration
sweating
was
induced
by
iontophoresis
of
pilocarpine
on
the
distal
forearm
in
no
case
did
the
concentrations
exceed
the
normal
upper
limit
for
this
procedure
and
no
difference
was
found
between
the
two
groups
in
this
way
the
study
failed
to
confirm
earlier
reports
of
elevated
sodium
chloride
concentrations
in
sweat
from
rusters
proposals
of
a
relationship
between
rusters
and
patients
with
pancreatic
cystic
fibrosis
were
not
substantiated
hyperhidrosis
of
the
palms
and
volar
surfaces
of
the
fingers
was
present
in
all
rusters
this
seemed
to
be
the
main
cause
of
the
corrosive
tendency
and
patients
referred
for
palmar
hyperhidrosis
were
found
to
produce
corrosion
similar
to
the
rusters
topical
application
of
aluminium
chloride
hexahydrate
in
a
solution
in
absolute
ethyl
alcohol
proved
effective
against
both
hyperhidrosis
and
the
corrosive
tendency
