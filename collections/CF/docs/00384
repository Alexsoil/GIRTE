serum
precipitins
against
respiratory
tract
pathogens
in
normal
children
and
cases
of
cystic
fibrosis
treated
with
cloxacillin
well
children
show
a
steady
increase
of
staphylococcal
precipitins
throughout
life
lower
incidences
are
found
for
precipitins
against
h
influenzae
pneumococcus
and
haemolytic
streptococcus
precipitins
against
proteus
pseudomonas
and
klibsiella
are
rare
there
are
marked
differences
between
the
normal
children
and
the
cloxacillin
treated
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
in
respect
to
pseudomonas
and
h
influenzae
which
rise
to
over
of
cystic
fibrosis
children
in
the
third
quinquennium
however
the
development
of
staphylococcal
precipitins
can
be
prevented
by
continuous
antistaphylococcal
therapy
