anorexia
nervosa
a
difficult
diagnosis
in
boys
illustrated
by
three
cases
the
three
patients
described
here
have
all
been
seen
recently
at
the
royal
hospital
for
sick
children
in
edinburgh
and
each
has
presented
a
diagnostic
problem
in
the
three
cases
presented
it
has
been
difficult
to
establish
the
true
diagnosis
in
the
first
case
symptoms
compatible
with
the
diagnostic
criteria
of
beumont
and
his
colleagues
were
directly
the
result
of
a
slow
growing
cerebral
neoplasm
which
was
elusive
to
diagnose
the
second
patient
a
boy
with
cystic
fibrosis
showed
symptoms
strongly
suggestive
of
anorexia
nervosa
and
responded
to
dietary
measures
without
pancreatic
enzyme
replacement
we
have
been
unable
to
demonstrate
any
organic
disease
in
the
third
case
and
hence
a
presumptive
diagnosis
of
anorexia
nervosa
has
been
made
it
remains
to
be
said
that
this
condition
is
extremely
rare
in
boys
and
that
anorexia
with
weight
loss
warrants
extremely
thorough
investigation
