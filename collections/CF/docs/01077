defective
cellular
immunity
to
gram
negative
bacteria
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
in
vitro
lymphocyte
responses
to
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
have
been
found
to
be
impaired
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
with
advanced
clinical
disease
the
responses
to
klebsiella
pneumoniae
serratia
marcescens
and
proteus
mirabilis
were
studied
in
a
similar
group
of
cystic
fibrosis
patients
and
normal
individuals
cystic
fibrosis
patients
found
to
be
unresponsive
to
pseudomonas
were
also
unresponsive
to
klebsiella
serratia
and
proteus
responsiveness
to
staphylococcus
aureus
was
not
impaired
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
we
postulate
that
in
vitro
lymphocyte
responses
to
several
gram
negative
bacteria
require
the
function
of
a
lymphocyte
subpopulation
which
may
be
impaired
in
some
cystic

patients
