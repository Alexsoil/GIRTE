abnormal
levels
of
cyclic
amp
in
isoproterenol
stimulated
fibroblasts
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
to
determine
if
the
abnormalities
of
exocrine
secretion
characteristic
of
cystic
fibrosis
could
be
investigated
in
vitro
i
studied
the
synthesis
of
cyclic
amp
after
isoproterenol
stimulation
in
skin
fibroblasts
derived
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
from
normal
individuals
comparison
of
normal
and
cystic
fibrosis
cells
showed
that
the
latter
had
to
fold
greater
levels
of
intracellular
cyclic
amp
after
stimulation
with
isoproterenol
the
difference
between
the
strains
was
observed
at
every
stage
of
the
culture
cycle
and
was
specific
to
stimulation
by
beta
adrenergic
agonists
it
could
not
be
accounted
for
by
different
dose
or
time
response
curves
nor
by
leakage
of
cyclic
amp
into
the
medium
the
increased
sensitivity
to
catecholamines
may
reflect
an
intrinsic
genetic
property
of
cystic
fibrosis
cells
and
it
may
be
feasible
to
use
this
system
to
study
the
biochemical
basis
of
the
genetic
defect
in
cystic
fibrosis
