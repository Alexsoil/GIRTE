the
search
for
the
basic
defect
in
cystic
fibrosis
has
so
far
been
singularly
disappointing
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
is
a
disease
recessively
inherited
ie
that
the
parents
carry
the
cystic
fibrosis
gene
without
showing
any
signs
of
ill
health
heterozygous
but
when
transmitted
from
both
of
them
to
an
offspring
this
child
manifests
the
disease
having
acquired
the
abnormal
gene
in
double
dose

of
metachromasia
that
seemed
to

for
a
classification

to

tantalising
