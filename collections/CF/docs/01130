methylumbelliferyl

reactive
proteases
and
prenatal
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
letter
for
several
reasons
the
supernatant
fraction
of
amniotic
fluid
is
not
often
used
in
the
prenatal
detection
of
inborn
errors
of
metabolism
in
early
pregnancy
the
bulk
of
the
protein
in
amniotic
fluid
is
derived
from
the
maternal
circulation
and
this
can
obscure
the
more
critical
contribution
from
the
fetus
needed
for
prenatal
diagnosis
of
amniotic
fluids
are
significantly
contaminated
with
maternal
blood
and
if
the
enzyme
in
question
is
present
in
this
blood
as
methylumbelliferyl
guanidinobenzoate
mugb
protease
is
this
can
further
distort
diagnostic
conclusions
for
this
reason
we
have
examined
the
variation
of
mugb
protease
in
a
heterogenous
collection
of
amniotic
fluids
no
significant
differences
in
titre
between
individual
weeks
in
the
second
trimester
were
observed
a
further
second
trimester
amniotic
fluids
from
pregnancies
with
abnormal
outcome
were
also
investigated
the
means
of
the
four
groups
were
not
significantly
different
from
that
of
the
normals
and
the
ranges
were
very
similar
we
have
not
yet
had
the
opportunity
to
examine
an
amniotic
fluid
from
a
known
case
of
cystic
fibrosis
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
could
probably
be
further
refined
by
coupling
amniotic
fluid
protease
titration
and
isoelectric
focusing
