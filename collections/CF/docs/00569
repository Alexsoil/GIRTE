genetic
studies
of
cystic
fibrosis
the
expression
of
the
gene
coding
for
the
cystic
fibrosis
ciliary
inhibitor
has
been
examined
in
somatic
cell
hybrid
clonal
lines
hybrids
were
produced
by
the
fusion
of
cultured
skin
fibroblasts
from
cystic
fibrosis
patients
with
mouse
rag
and
lm
tk
cell
lines
the
ciliary
inhibitor
was
detected
by
the
oyster
ciliary
assay
in
several
primary
hybrid
clones
but
not
detected
in
others
indicating
the
segregation
of
an
associated
nuclear
gene
