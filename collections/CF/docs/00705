an
expanding
challenge
for
internal
medicine
the
number
of
adults
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
receiving
care
from
the
us
cystic
fibrosis
centers
has
been
increasing
at
an
average
rate
of
about
patients
each
year
a
model
based
on
the
continuation
of
this
rate
of
increase
predicts
that
almost
adults
will
be
receiving
care
at
the
centers
by
the
end
of
four
other
models
developed
are
based
on
continuation
of
a
steady
state
with
two
variations
a
reduction
in
mortality
and
universal
newborn
screening
these
models
show
the
boundaries
of
an
equilibrium
population
to
be
between
and
patients
with
to
adults
