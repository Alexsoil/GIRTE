anaesthetic
management
of
volume
controlled
unilateral

conventional
means
to
facilitate
clearance
of
inspissated
material
obstructing
gas
exchange
in
the
alveoli
and
finer
airways
of
patients
with
alveolar
proteinosis
asthma
and
mucoviscidosis
are
often
not
very
effective
the
mechanical
removal
of
such
materials
by
volume
controlled
unilateral
lung
lavage
with
saline
has
been
of
benefit
in
selected
patients
refractory
to
conventional
therapy
particularly
those
with

particles
this
report
describes
the
anaesthetic
and
lavage
techniques
currently
used
in
managing
patients
with
alveolar
proteinosis
and
mucoviscidosis
and
in
whom
lung
lavage
repeated
at
approximately
six
month
intervals
has
resulted
in
both
subjective
and
objective
improvements
in
lavages
in
four
different
patients
lavages
in
two
patients
with
alveolar
proteinosis
and
four
lavages
in
two
patients
with
mucoviscidosis
certain
physiologic
responses
to
lung
lavage
particularly
those
related
to
oxygen
transport
were
measured
quantitatively
in
an
attempt
to
evaluate
and
to
optimize
anaesthetic
and
lavage
techniques
the
maintenance
anaesthetic
during
lavage
was
selected
randomly
so
that
each
patient
received
light
anaesthesia
with
ketamine
diazepam
during
one
lavage
and
light
halothane
anaesthesia
during
lavage
of
the
contralateral
lung
