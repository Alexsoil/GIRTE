standardization
of
a
new
minor
salivary
gland
collecting
procedure
for
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
the
objective
of
this
investigation
was
to
further
refine
a
technique
developed
to
serve
as
a
new
test
procedure
for
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
utilizing
a
more
quantitative
approach
for
measuring
in
a
standard
fashion
the
volume
of
secretion
of
the
minor
salivary
glands
of
the
lower
labial
mucosa
which
can
be
collected
over
a
fixed
period
of
time
it
was
also
hoped
that
such
standardization
would
facilitate
the
more
accurate
study
of
all
aspects
of
study
of
minor
salivary
gland
secretion
collected
in
this
fashion
from
the
findings
it
is
obvious
that
less
minor
salivary
gland
secretion
was
collected
from
cystic
fibrosis
patients
than
from
normal
control
subjects
using
a
capillary
tube
test
this
may
be
due
in
part
to
an
increased
viscosity
of
minor
salivary
gland
saliva
in
cystic
fibrosis
unfortunately
viscosity
studies
were
beyond
the
scope
of
this
investigation
the
results
indicate
that
the
relative
differences
between
the
volume
of
minor
salivary
secretion
collected
at
a
standard
test
site
and
that
collected
over
the
total
lower
labial
mucosa
are
similar
the
volumetric
differences
in
minor
salivary
secretion
have
again
been
found
to
be
distinctive
enough
to
suggest
that
studies
be
continued
in
this
area
to
further
refine
a
diagnostic
test
procedure
for
cystic
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
at
the
present
time
studies
are
in
progress
to
measure
the
volume
of
minor
salivary
secretion
at
a
standard
test
site
employing
an
electronic
technique
it
is
hoped
that
this
approach
may
permit
the
elimination
of
viscosity
as
a
variable
