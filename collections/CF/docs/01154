intestinal
lactase
deficiency
in
newborns
with
cystic
fibrosis
dietary
consequences
the
problem
of
proper
diet
to
children
and
infants
with
cystic
fibrosis
is
continuously
discussed
this
paper
deals
with
the
diet
for
cf
infants
younger
than
one
year
the
basic
view
is
that
the
diet
should
be
as
close
to
the
normal
baby
diet
as
possible
partly
to
ensure
normal
growth
and
development
and
partly
to
avoid
extra
work
for
the
families
with
cf
infants
infants
suffering
from
cf
were
given
lactose
free
diet
until
they
reached
the
age
of
one
year
the
weight
increased
more
rapidly
than
in
cf
patients
given
the
traditional
cf
diet
with
low
fat
and
high
protein
furthermore
it
was
not
necessary
to
give
increased
amounts
of
calories
to
the
infants
given
lactose
free
diet
nor
did
they
receive
additional
fat
soluble
vitamins
