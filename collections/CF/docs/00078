intracisternal
inclusion

induced
in
animals
their
transformation
and
significance
intracisternal
granules
palade
or
inclusion
bodies
occurring
within
the
cisternae
of
the
rough
surfaced
endoplasmic
reticulum
have
been
observed
not
only
in
normal
conditions
but
also
in
some
experimental
conditions
in
this
paper
such
intracisternal
inclusion
bodies
were
induced
or
found
in
a
variety
of
animals
following
chemical
administrations
artificial
hibernation
and
cold
exposure
and
also
with
cystic
fibrosis
these
inclusion
bodies
are
tentatively
classified
into
types
based
upon
their
morphological
aspects
the
formation
fate
and
significance
of
these
bodies
are
also
discussed
