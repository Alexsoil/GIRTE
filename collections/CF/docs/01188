a
pilot
study
prone
immersion
physical
exercise
therapy
has
been
used
successfully
in
the
physical
rehabilitation
of
middle
aged
adults
with
moderate
to
severe
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
the
purpose
of
this
pilot
project
was
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
pipe
therapy
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
three
children
with
cf
two
boys
aged
and
years
and
one
girl
aged
years
voluntarily
participated
in
the
experimental
training
program
the
patients
performed
individualized
group
exercise
three
times
a
week
on
alternate
days
for
consecutive
weeks
at
an
intensity
of
approximately
percent
aerobic
capacity
duration
of
exercise
gradually
increased
from
x
minutes
to
x
minutes
minutes
while
the
rest
period
after
each
exercise
was
constant
at
two
minutes
pipe
training
resulted
in
increased
physical
work
capacity
and
maximal
oxygen
consumption
in
all
three
subjects
curiously
these
changes
were
not
accompanied
by
training
bradycardia
