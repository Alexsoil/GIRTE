potential
management
through
manipulation
of
the
secretory
process
in
affected
exocrine
glands
ten
years
ago
we
demonstrated
that
chronic
administration
of
isoproterenol
to
rats
results
is
structural
and
functional
changes
of
their
salivary
glands
similar
to
those
seen
in
exocrine
glands
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
recently
we
began
to
study
the
cellular
pathophysiology
of
these
glands
and
managed
to
achieve
pharmacological
control
of
this
abnormality
we
demonstrated
that
administration
of
a
beta
adrenergic
antagonist
in
these
animals
resulted
in
the
correction
of
the
electrolyte
abnormality
which
is
very
similar
to
that
seen
in
the
sweat
glands
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
these
two
examples
of
manipulation
of
the
secretory
processes
in
exocrine
glands
of
experimental
animals
demonstrate
the
feasibility
of
this
approach
in
the
therapy
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
