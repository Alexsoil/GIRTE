motility
suspensions
of
proteus

were
rapidly
agglutinated
by
serum
from
cystic

patients
serum
from
obligate
heterozygotes
exhibited
a
mean
agglutination
time
that
was
significantly
less
than
that
observed
for
controls
the
agglutinating
property
was
observed
to
be
transmitted
through
several
generations
and
through
both
maternal
and
paternal
branches
of
the
pedigrees
qualitative
differences
were
noted
with

inducing
the
formation
of
clumps
that
were
two

larger
than
those
observed
