the
precipitins
and
hypersensitivity
reactions
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
large
number
and
wide
variety
of
precipitins
detected
in
the
sputum
of
cystic
fibrosis
patients
suggest
that
the
precipitins
may
be
nonprotective
and
even
harmful
to
the
patients
these
sputum
precipitins
were
directed
principally
against
food
fungi
bacteria
and
human
body
tissue
on
the
other
hand
precipitins
to
staphylococcus
alpha
hemolysin
was
the
main
type
of
immunoprecipitin
detected
in
cf
serum
and
was
found
in
of
the
serum
specimens
examined
it
seems
likely
that
the
precipitins
in
patients
with
cf
may
be
involved
in
the
formation
of
immune
complexes
which
in
conjunction
with
complement
may
be
responsible
for
the
respiratory
and
gastrointestinal
lesions
that
are
common
in
patients
with
cf
the
immune
complexes
may
be
the
result
of
excess
food
and
bacterial
antigens
escaping
across
the
gut
and
lungs
as
a
result
of
some
abnormality
of
the
siga
system
over
of
the
sputum
specimens
tested
gave
positive
precipitins
in
agar
gel
against
human
seminal
fluid
and
colostrum
suggesting
that
some
of
the
antibodies
formed
in
cf
patients
could
be
directed
against
host
tissue
and
may
account
for
an
autoimmune
type
reaction
in
cf
crossreaction
between
the
high
titer
antibody
to
staphylococcus
and
basement
membrane
of
lungs
and
pancreas
with
complement
activation
may
occur
in
cf
and
required
further
study
the
high
number
of
b
cells
as
detected
by
antibody
coated
complement
activated
sheep
erythrocytes
and
eac
rosettes
may
be
partly
responsible
for
the
synthesis
of
the
variety
of
antibodies
detected
in
cf
patients
