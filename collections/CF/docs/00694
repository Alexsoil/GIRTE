the
syndrome

inappropriate
antidiuretic
hormone
adh
secretion
siadh
as
a
cause
of
hyponatremia
in
cystic
fibrosis
cf
we
are
puzzled
by
certain
unusual
phenomena
in
the
two
cases
presented
we
agree
that
it
would
be
important
to
recognize
the
occurrence
of
adh
mediated
hyponatremia
in
cf
we
would
though
appreciate
the
authors
comments
on
the
weight
losses
and
the
fluid
and
electrolyte
balances
early
in
these
patients
s
courses
also
helpful
would
be
information
on
furosemide
dosage
and
any
other
drugs
such
as
acetaminophen
which
may
have
been
given
so
we
can
further
understand
the
pathophysiology
of
these
two
complex
patients
we
do
not
think
there
was
hypovolemia
in
either
case
patient
was
given
only
one
dose
of
mg
of
acetaminophen
on
the
fourth
day
of
hospitalization
during
recovery
patient
received
only
one
dose
of
acetaminophen
mg
at
am
on
the
twenty
first
day
of
admission
after
recovery
both
patients
were
receiving
antibiotics
and
patient
was
receiving
digitalis
as
well
the
reason
for
production
of
adh
remains
obscure
as
it
is
in
most
cases
of
siadh
although
it
was
mentioned
in
the
discussion
that
the
transient
nature
of
siadh
in
these
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
would
argue
against
the
production
of
this
hormone
in
the
lung
