cystic
fibrosis
demonstration
of
an
abnormality
in
mucopolysaccharides
in
cultured
lymphoid
lines
cultured
lymphoid
cells
of
both
homozygotes
and
heterozygotes
for
cystic
fibrosis
could
be
distinguished
from
those
of
normals
by
growth
pattern
gross
clumping
and
a
relative
increase
in
dermatan
sulfate
with
a
normal
total
mucopolysaccharide
content
lines
derived
from
the
genetic
mucopolysaccharidoses
also
had
these
characteristics
but
their
total
mucopolysaccharide
content
was
markedly
increased
these
observations
support
the
hypothesis
that
the
cellular
disturbance
in
cystic
fibrosis
resides
in
those
cellular
regions
whose
functions
would
be
altered
by
mucopolysaccharide
composition
