influence
of
cystic
fibrotic
and
heterozygous
serum
on
rat
jejunum
the
rat
jejunum
bioassay
has
been
shown
to
be
capable
of
identifying
both
the
cystic
fibrotic
homozygote
and
heterozygote
and
therefore
would
appear
to
have
great
potential
as
a
screening
test
for
the
latter
it
is
suggested
that
the
cystic
fibrosis
factor
does
not
influence
sodium
reabsorption
by
inhibiting
an
active
sodium
reabsorption
mechanism
but
rather
by
inhibiting
passive
sodium
entry
into
the
cell
