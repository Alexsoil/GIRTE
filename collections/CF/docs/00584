distribution
of
serum
amylase
isoenzymes
in
cystic
fibrosis
homozygotes
and
heterozygotes
a
simple
method
has
been
elaborated
for
the
routine
separation
and
quantitative
determination
of
amylase
isoenzymes
the
ratio
p
s
the
quotient
of
the
activity
values
obtained
by
densitometric
evaluation
of
the
pancreatic
and
salivary
isoenzymes
is
used
to
characterize
their
distribution
in
healthy
adults
and
children
the
value
for
p
s
is
above
in
of
the
cases
with
a
mean
of
in
of
heterozygote
cf
gene
carriers
the
p
s
is
below
with
a
mean
of
in
addition
to
the
higher
total
amylase
activity
in
mv
homozygote
patients
p
s
is
less
than
and
even
the
phenomenon
is
explained
by
a
compensatory
enhancement
of
salivary
activity
the
method
is
a
suitable
diagnostic
test
of
the
exocrine
function
of
the
pancreas
and
for
evaluation
of
the
serum
amylase
isoenzymes
the
p
s
value
allows
to
differentiate
heterozygote
cf
gene
carriers
from
homozygotes
and
healthy
individuals
