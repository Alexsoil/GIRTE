fibrosis
cystic
fibrosis
fibrocystic
disease
of
the
pancreas
is
a
common
inherited
disease
which
to
date
still
has
a
fatal
outcome
the
diversity
of
clinical
manifestations
and
pathological
findings
has
added
further
to
the
mysterious
nature
of
the
disease
as
have
the
tantalizingly
conflicting
results
of
biochemical
physical
and
experimental
studies
in
many
laboratories
of
the
western
world
one
of
the
most
constant
clinical
observations
is
the
viscosity
of
the
secretion
of
the
mucosal
glands
in
the
respiratory
and
alimentary
tracts
in
the
ducts
of
the
biliary
system
and
in
the
pancreas
in
approximately
to
per
cent
of
all
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
the
earliest
manifestation
meconium
ileus
occurs
in
the
neonatal
period
in
the
remaining
to
per
cent
of
affected
infants
the
symptoms
generally
become
evident
within
the
course
of
the
first
year
of
life
the
lung
symptoms
tend
to
dominate
the
clinical
picture
in
the
vast
majority
of
untreated
patients
and
will
ultimately
decide
the
outcome
the
lower
respiratory
tract
is
not
the
only
part
involved
nasal
polyps
and
the
accumulation
of
viscous
secretions
in
the
paranasal
sinuses
with
subsequent
bacterial
infection
are
not
unusual
pancreatic
deficiency
is
present
in
the
vast
majority
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
consists
of
a
gross
reduction
or
complete
absence
of
exocrine
secretion
although
some
histological
damage
has
been
seen
in
the
neonatal
period
in
infants
suffering
from
meconium
ileus
in
general
the
full
blown
picture
of
extensive
cirrhosis
with
portal
hypertension
hepatosplenomegaly
and
severe
and
sometimes
fatal
haemorrhages
from
oesophageal
varices
is
seen
in
the
older
child
and
adolescent
screening
of
the
newborn
to
enable
the
institution
of
protective
measures
before
lung
complications
arise
has
been
attempted
with
various
techniques
management
includes
diet
and
pancreatic
enzyme
replacement
the
treatment
of
pulmonary
disease
is
the
most
important
aspect
of
care
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
its
prevention
is
priority
number
one
in
the
over
all
management
the
outlook
for
the
child
born
with
cystic
fibrosis
depends
to
a
large
extent
upon
the
avoidance
or
delay
until
adult
life
of
the
two
complications
that
threaten
his
existence
cor
pulmonale
and
cirrhosis
of
the
liver
