epidemiological
investigations
of
the
respiratory
tract
bacteriology
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
seventy
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
treated
as
out
patients
in
a
cystic
fibrosis
clinic
have
been
followed
during
one
year
by
monthly
bacteriological
examinations
of
tracheal
secretions
the
daily
impression
obtained
in
the
laboratory
is
expressed
by
the
mean
point
prevalence
rate
of
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
per
cent
staphylococcus
aureus
per
cent
haemophilus
influenzae
per
cent
diplococcus
pneumoniae
per
cent
and
miscellaneous
other
bacteria
mainly
enterobacteriaceae
per
cent
the
fluctuations
of
the
bacteriology
are
described
by
additional
epidemiological
terms
at
one
or
more
examinations
during
the
study
period
prevalence

per

of
the
patients
harboured
st

per

ps

mainly
mucoid
strains
per
cent
h
influenzae
per
cent
d

and
per
cent
miscellaneous
other
bacteria
mainly
enterobacteriaceae
this
pattern
was
found
in
all
age
groups
with
minor
age
dependent
modifications
especially
as
regards
enterobacteriaceae
ps
aeruginosa
was
predominating
as
regards
chronic
colonization
which
reflects
the
most
difficult
therapeutic
problems
the
period
prevalence
rate
being
per
cent
in
contrast
to
st
aureus
per
cent
and
h
influenzae
per
cent
st
aureus
was
predominating
as
regards
new
colonization
and
recolonization
which
reflect
the
problems
of
prevention
the
incidence
rate
of
new
colonization
and
recolonization
per
risk
group
being
per
cent
followed
by
h
influenzae
per
cent
ps
aeruginosa
per
cent
and
d
pneumoniae
per
cent
the
results
show
that
the
bacteriological
problems
in
cystic
fibrosis
are
still
considerable
as
regards
therapy
as
well
as
prevention
although
many
species
may
colonize
the
respiratory
tracts
of
these
patients
the
main
clinical
problems
concern
ps
aeruginosa
and
st
aureus
the
reason

is
discussed
