is
cystic
fibrosis
protein
a
diagnostic
marker
for
individuals
who
harbor
the
defective
gene
letter
it
has
been
almost
years
since
the
publication
of
our
original
report
describing
a
cystic
fibrosis
factor
now
designated
cystic
fibrosis
protein
or
cfp
detected
in
the
serum
of
most
homozygotes
and
heterozygotes
for
cystic
fibrosis
when
analyzed
using
isoelectric
focusing
in
thin
layer
polyacrylamide
gels
the
recent
report
by
scholey
et
al
confirms
that
cfp
is
present
in
the
majority
of
cf
sera
and
that
it
can
be
detected
by
our
methods
before
discussing
whether
the
cfp
can
be
used
as
a
diagnostic
marker
for
cystic
fibrosis
we
would
like
to
examine
more
closely
some
of
the
requirements
of
the
method
which
seemed
to
have
been
critical
for
the
detection
of
cfp
by
scholey
et
al
we
would
like
to
point
out
that
scholey
and
his
coworkers
adhered
closely
to
most
of
our
guidelines
during
their
attempts
to
detect
cfp
the
exact
nature
of
cfp
and
the
other
ciliary
dyskinesia
factors
is
only
partially
known
and
all
aspects
of
their
metabolism
are
not
yet
understood
therefore
it
may
be
some
time
before
we
comprehend
the
incomplete
concordance
found
between
cfp
and
the
pathogenesis
of
cf
