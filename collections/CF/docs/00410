altered
isoenzyme
patterns
of
liver
alpha
l
fucosidase
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
isoenzyme
pattern
of
alpha
l
fucosidase
was
studied
by
isoelectric
focusing
in
livers
from
seven
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
in
normal
and
pathological
gm
gangliosidosis
type
ii
and
sanfilippo
disease
controls
the
controls
had
very
reproducible
patterns
consisting
of
seven
isoenzymes
of
alpha
l
fucosidase
with
the
most
neutral
from
i
representing
a
small
proportion
of
the
total
activity
all
seven
of
the
cystic
fibrosis
livers
had
altered
alpha
l
fucosidase
isoenzyme
patterns
the
chemical
relationship
of
the
seven
isoenzymes
of
normal
liver
alpha
l
fucosidase
was
investigated
using
neuramindase
the
five
most
acidic
forms
of
alpha
l
fucosidase
appear
to
be
related
to
the
most
neutral
form
by
sialic
acid
residues
since
the
isoenzymes
of
liver
alpha
l
fucosidase
appear
to
be
related
by
sialic
acid
residues
it
is
possible
that
the
altered
alpha
l
fucosidase
isoenzyme
patterns
found
in
cystic
fibrosis
livers
may
result
from
aberrant
sialylation
