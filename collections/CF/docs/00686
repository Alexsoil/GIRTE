the
pharmacokinetics
of
amikacin
in
children
the
pharmacokinetic
variables
of
amikacin
were
measured
in
children
and
adolescents
four
to
years
of
age
the
mean
plasma
clearance
of
amikacin
was
ml

the
major
route
of
elimination
was
renal
simultaneously
measured
inulin
clearance
showed
that
a
majority
of
the
drug
filtered
by
the
kidneys
was
excreted
in
the
urine
the
mean
volume
of
distribution
of
amikacin
was

weight
half

during
the
final
pseudoequilibrium
phase
averaged

no
significant
accumulation
of
the
drug
was
seen
when
four
doses
were
given
intravenously
at
mg

every
hours
the
plasma
concentration
just
before
injection
of
the
fourth
dose
averaged
plus

the

when
the
dose
was
expressed
in
terms
of
milligrams
per
kilogram
it
was
found
that
children
often
needed
to
more
of
the
drug
compared
to
adults
to
achieve
equivalent
plasma
concentrations
this
larger
requirement
was
primarily
due
to
a
higher
clearance
of
amikacin
in
proportion
to
body

dosages

on

resulted
in
