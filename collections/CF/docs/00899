diagnosis
of
exocrine
pancreatic
insufficiency
in
cystic
fibrosis
by
the
synthetic
peptide
n
benzoyl
l
tyrosyl
p
aminobenzoic
acid
the
synthetic
peptide
n
benzoyl
l
tyrosyl
p
aminobenzoic
acid
is
specifically
cleaved
by
chymotrypsin
to
bz
ty
and
paba
the
liberated
paba
is
absorbed
and
excreted
in
the
urine
accordingly
paba
recovery
reflects
intraluminal
chymotrypsin
activity
and
is
an
index
of
exocrine
pancreatic
function
this
test
was
evaluated
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
to
determine
its
role
in
the
diagnosis
of
exocrine
pancreatic
insufficiency
cumulative
percent
paba
recovery
in
six
hours
was
significantly
lower
in
cf
patients
compared
with
the
control
group
no
overlap
was
noted
between
the
two
groups
there
was
good
correlation
between
paba
recovery
fecal
chymotrypsin
activity
and
coefficient
of
fat
absorption
these
findings
indicate
that
paba
recovery
is
significantly
reduced
in
patients
with
cf
and
steatorrhea
and
may
prove
a
practical
and
reliable
test
of
pancreatic
insufficiency
