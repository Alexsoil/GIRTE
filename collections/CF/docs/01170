the
local
immune
status
in
cystic
fibrosis
we
focused
our
study
on
concentration
of
immunoglobulins
lysozyme
lactoferrin
some
antiproteolytic
fractions
and
acute
phase
proteins
in
bronchial
secretion
of
children
with
various
pulmonary
diseases
especially
with
cystic

secretory
iga
is
decreased
in
all
studied
groups
of
patients
having
chronic
or
recurrent
infections
of
the
respiratory
tract
when
compared
to
the
group
of
healthy
children
groups
which
were
characterized
by
the
infection
of
the
lower
part
of
the
respiratory
tract
had
increased
lysozyme
level
the
results
obtained
in
the
group
of
cf
children
are
similar
to
those
obtained
in
groups
with
bronchiectasis
and
chronic
bronchitis
which
suggests
that
the
observed
differences
are
characteristic
for
chronic
infection
rather
than
for
cf
although
in
cf
as
well
as
in
bronchiectasis
massive
bacterial
infection
results
in
increased
concentration
of
immunoglobulins
antiproteolytic
fractions
and
acute

proteins
the
results
seen
in
both
groups
are
somewhat
different
these
differences
may
indicate
some
difference
in
the
reactivity
to
infection
of
the
respiratory
tract
in
cf
in
comparison
to
patients
with
bronchiectasis
it
seems
conceivable
that
among
children
with
cf
who
have
very
low

iga
chronic
respiratory
tract
infections
occur
earlier
and
igg
response
to
permanent
exposition
to
variety
of
antigens
is
less
vigorous
the
presented
results
raise
also
a
possibility
that
the
bacterial
infection
in
cf
does
not
stimulate
defence
mechanisms
to
the
same
extent
as
in
bronchiectasis
