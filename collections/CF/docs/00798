and
exocrine

letter
we
have
observed
severe
meconium
plug
syndrome
mps
in
a
newborn
infant
who
was
found
during
the
neonatal
period
to
have
extensive
exocrine
pancreatic
deficiency
cystic
fibrosis
was
excluded
by
several
sweat
chloride
tests
our
observation
of
mps
in
a
patient
with
exocrine
pancreatic
deficiency
suggests
that
the
mps
observed
in
the
cf
patients
reported
by
rosenstein
is
probably
caused
by
pancreatic
deficiency
the
frequent
occurrence
of
meconium
ileus
mi
in
cf
and
the
rarity
of
mps
in
cf
is
curious
since
they
may
be
different
manifestations
of
the
same
pathologic
process
conceivably
mps
may
occur
with
total
absence
of
pancreatic
enzymes
as
in
our
patient
and
in
a
few
patients
with
cf
low
levels
of
enzymes
in
cf
may
limit
expression
to
meconium
ileus
we
wish
to
suggest
the
evaluation
of
exocrine
pancreatic
function
in
these
patients
even
if
cf
has
been
excluded
by
sweat
tests
there
is
conflicting
albeit
fragmentary
data
suggesting
that
exocrine
pancreatic
deficiency
may
not
be
the
sole
cause
of
meconium
obstruction
in
cf
several
investigators
have
suggested
that
mi
may
be
the
result
of
abnormal
protein
and
mucoprotein
secretions
by
the
intestinal
goblet
cells
and
not
from
lack
of
pancreatic
enzymes
alone
while
these
observations
suggest
that
exocrine
pancreatic
deficiency
may
not
play
a
major
role
in
all
instance
of
meconium
obstruction
it
is
important
to
note
that
there
may
be
little
correlation
between
the
histologic
appearance
of
the
pancreas
and
exocrine
function
