cystic
fibrosis
cf
like
syphilis
could
accurately
be
described
as
the
great
imitator
many
organ
systems
are
involved
and
a
clear
understanding
of
the
disease
and
its
many
complications
is
a
useful
exercise
in
understanding
human
physiology
cf
could
be
called
thick
secretion
disease
because
all
exocrine
fluids
like
pancreatic
juice
are
thick
or
it
could
be
called
multimystery
disease
because
there
are
so
many
unanswered
questions
about
it
many
manifestations
of
cf
are
understandable
complications
of
malabsorption
malnutrition
and
the
physical
and
chemical
effects
of
abnormal
exocrine
secretion
others
including
the
susceptibility
to
recurrent
nasal
polyps
the
hypersalinized
sweat
low
female
fertility
and
male
sterility
given
present
knowledge
do
not
make
physiologic
sense
