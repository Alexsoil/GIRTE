nutritional
supplementation
in
cystic
fibrosis
duke
medical
center
and
the
national
institutes
of
health
have
analyzed
the
maximum
achieved
heights
and
weights
of
persons
with
cf
over
years
old
both
parameters
were
markedly
skewed
toward
the
lower
percentile
bands
no
significant
differences
were
found
among
patients
whose
condition
was
diagnosed
early
in
life
in
those
with
more
severe
pulmonary
or
gastrointestinal
impairment
or
among
those
in
whom
pancreatic
enzyme
and
or
nutritional
supplementation
had
been
employed
nutritional
supplementation
has
yet
to
be
proven
a
significant
long
term
influence
on
the
morbidity
or
mortality
of
cf
lober
reported
data
on
persons
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
over
years
of
age
while
our
population
of
individuals
contained
only
three
who
were
over
years
old
the
median
age
of
death
in
patients
with
cf
is
years
it
is
not
realistic
to
compare
patients
who
have
survived
to
adulthood
with
a
younger
group
he
did
not
state
the
type
of
nutritional
supplementation
that
was
of
no
significance
among
his
patients
our
experience
with
nutritional
supplements
other
than
the
amino
acid
glucose
polymer
mixture
has
been
equally
poor
our
data
on
growth
rates
were
similar
to
those
of
lober
in
that
both
heights
and
weights
were
skewed
toward
the
lower
end
and
height
was
less
affected
than
weight
increased
rates
of
linear
growth
were
observed
in
eight
of
children
under
years
of
age
at
the
time
the
dietary
supplement
was
begun
patients
who
continue
to
take
the
nutritional
supplement
have
not
shown
further
deterioration
in
pulmonary
status
