the
repair
of
dna
single
strand
breaks
in
human
cells
with
genetical
disorders
the
aim
of
this
work
was
to
make
a
preliminary
examination
of
some
hereditary
diseases
related
to
precocious
aging
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
defects
involved
resulted
from
an
impairment
of
the
dna
repair
capacity
to
test
for
an
impairment
in
dna
single
strand
capacity
in
cells
from
patients
with
different
diseases
we
have
followed
the
rate
of
the
dna
after
x
irradiation
by
sedimentation
on
alkaline
sucrose
gradients
it
was
found
that
all
cells
observed
from
lesh
nyhan
cystic
fibrosis
trisomy
et
retinoblastoma
were
able
to
repair
the
single
strand
breaks
in
their
dna
to
the
same
extent
and
at
the
same
initial
rate
