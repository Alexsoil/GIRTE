intellectual
development
after
severe
malnutrition
in
infancy
intellectual
performance
sensory
motor
abilities
and
social
adaptation
were
studied
in
subjects
to
years
of
age
who
had
severe
malnutrition
in
infancy
a
control
group
consisted
of
siblings
the
mean
iq
of
parents
ws
s
d
plus
or
minus
socioeconomic
deprivation
was
not
present
the
results
of
the
merrill
palmer
test
for
the
malnourished
group
and
the
controls
revealed
significant
differences
in
favor
of
the
controls
no
differences
were
found
in
the
older
population
for
whom
the
wisc
and
wais
were
used
the
lincoln
oseretsky
test
of
motor
development
and
the
vineland
scale
of
social
maturity
showed
no
significant
differences
these
results
are
consistent
with
the
hypothesis
that
malnutrition
in
infancy
can
affect
intellectual
development
in
the
first
five
years
of
life
beyond
this
age
given
adequate
socioeconomic
support
no
significant
differences
were
observed
