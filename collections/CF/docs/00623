alpha
l
fucosidase
activity
is
elevated
in
skin
fibroblasts
from
cystic
fibrosis
patients
when
compared
to
controls
the
activities
of
nine
other
acid
hydrolases
including
neuraminidase
are
similar
in
cystic
fibrosis
and
control
fibroblasts
the
relationship
of
these
results
to
the
recent
finding
of
a
decreased
activity
of
alpha
l
fucosidase
in
the
serum
of
cystic
fibrosis
patients
is
discussed
it
is
proposed
that
an
abnormal
distribution
of
alpha
l
fucosidase
is
involved
in
the
pathogenesis
of
this
disease
