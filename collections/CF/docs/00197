congenital
metabolic
diseases
of
pediatric
patients
anesthetic
implications
the
large
number
of
congenital
metabolic
disorders
makes
a
complete
discussion
of
the
biochemical
problems
hazards
pharmacologic
implications
and
anesthetic
recommendations
for
each
impossible
this
review
is
confined
to
discussion
of
certain
aspects
of
several
genetically
acquired
diseases
of
metabolism
which
the
anaesthesiologist
may
be
called
upon
to
manage
in
the
pediatric
patient
every
genetic
metabolic
disease
is
the
result
of
a
specific
enzyme
defect
or
defects
in
function
or
in
amount
in
this
review
diseases
in
which
defects
are
known
e
g
homocystinuria
suspected
e
g
myotonia
congenita
and
unknown
e
g
cystic
fibrosis
are
discussed
therapeutic
approaches
to
genetic
metabolic
disease
include
supplying
the
missing
product
preventing
substrate
accumulation
preventing
alternate
product
synthesis
enzyme
induction
enzyme
replacement
increasing
deficient
function
with
cofactor
administration
and
compensatory
therapy
obviously
the
ideal
way
to
treat
the
consequences
of
a
genetic
disease
is
to
normalize
the
patient
biochemically
for
diseases
where
the
pathophysiology
is
clear
this
goal
is
approachable
for
conditions
where
the
pathophysiology
is
unknown
only
compensatory
therapy
is
possible
