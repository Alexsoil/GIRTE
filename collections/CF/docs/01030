plasma

lipids
of

diploid
fibroblasts
from
normal
individuals
and
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
lipid
composition
of
isolated
plasma
membranes
of
human
skin
fibroblasts
is
described
for
the
first
time
plasma
membranes
from
a
number
of
strains
of
fibroblasts
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
matched
normals
were
isolated
by
a
recently
described
procedure
and
analysed
for
major
phospholipid
classes
cholesterol
and
fatty
acids
no
differences
in
the
quantities
of
these
compounds
were
detected
between
cells
of
the
two
different
origins
the
fetal
calf
serum
used
to
supplement
the
growth
medium
contained
relatively
more
palmitoleate
and
oleate
but
less
stearate
than
the
membranes
there
were
also
no
consistent
differences
between
cystic
fibrosis
and
normal
membranes
in
terms
of
the
fatty
acid
compositions
of
their
individual
phospholipid
classes
consistent
with
this
lack
of
chemical
change
in
the
lipids
of
membranes
of
cystic
fibrosis
cells
the
degree
of
fluorescence
polarization
of
diphenylhexatriene
an
index
of
fluidity
was
also
unchanged
