cf
was
studied
in
mutant
mice
with
some
hereditary
alterations
resembling
this
inherited
disease
a
test
was
developed
to
detect
sca
in
biologic
fluids
by
means
of
a
natural
vibratile
system
it
consisted
in
the
incubation
of
mouse
sperm
with
different
cf
serum
dilutions
under
controlled
conditions
in
order
to
determine
the
sperm
translation

stct
and
the

sact
as
the
findings
of
this
study
were
similar
to
those
obtained
by
other
authors
who
have
been
employing
alternative
systems
it
was
decided
to
apply
this
method
on

serum

from

sca
was
investigated
in

homozygotes

their

were
used
as

male

employed

significant

found
between

in
both

sact
determinations
at

it
is
concluded
that
mouse
sperm
is
a
system
sensitive
enough
to
detect

in
biologic

from
human

likewise
the
test
of

allowed

to
detect
