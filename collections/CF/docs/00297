fibrosis
cystic
fibrosis
cf
is
a
generalized
disorder
of
the
exocrine
glands
inherited
as
a
recessive
genetic
trait
the
disease
was
more
fully
described
as
a
specific
entity
in
with
a
pathology
of
dilated
ducts
and
fibrotic
changes
in
the
pancreas
and
copious
secretory
intraluminal
obstruction
of
the
bronchial
tree
the
symptoms
predominately
involve
the
gastrointestinal
tract
as
more
frequent
bulky
malformed
and
malodorous
stools
and
the
respiratory
system
as
cough
wheezing
and
signs
of
chronic
respiratory
obstruction
in
certain
instances
only
one
of
these
two
systems
will
have
manifest
symptoms
and
signs
an
increased
concentration
of
sodium
and
chloride
in
the
sweat
was
discovered
in
the
elevated
salt
concentration
of
the
sweat
has
proven
to
be
a
reliable
diagnostic
tool
to
confirm
the
presence
of
the
disease
few
diseases
present
in
so
many
different
forms
degrees
of
severity
and
at
different
ages
as
does
cf
all
present
treatments
for
cystic
fibrosis
are
essentially
symptomatic
since
the
study
of
families
having
a
child
with
cystic
fibrosis
has
shown
an
incidence
of
the
disease
in
one
fourth
of
their
siblings
classification
of
the
disease
as
an
autosomal
recessive
genetic
disorder
suggests
that
the
concept
of
an
abnormal
gene
related
to
alteration
in
a
single
enzyme
should
apply
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
childhood
is
an
overwhelming
even
to
the
patient
and
his
family
