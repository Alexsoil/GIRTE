lysosomal
hydrolases
in
cystic
fibrosis
livers
the
specific
activity
of
several
lysosomal
hydrolases
in
normal
and
cystic
fibrosis
cf
livers
has
been
investigated
neuraminidase
activity
with
respect
to
two
natural
substrates
fetuin
and
bovine
submaxillary
mucin
is
normal
in
cf
livers
no
significant
differences
were
found
between
cf
and
normal
livers
in
methylumbelliferyl
alpha
d
mannosidase
specific
activities
determined
at
three
different
ph
values
and
corresponding
to
lysosomal
golgi
and
cytosolic
components
of
the
enzyme
respectively
the
specific
activities
of
p
nitrophenyl
beta
d
mannosidase
and
methylumbelliferyl
beta
n
acetylglucosaminidase
were
also
both
similar
in
cf
and
normal
livers
