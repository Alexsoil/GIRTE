bronchial
lability
in
children
suffering
from
some
diseases
of
the
bronchi
the
authors
studied
bronchial
reactivity
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
with
deformative
bronchitis
the
reaction
of
the
bronchi
was
studied
both
by
inhalatory
and
exercise
provocation
inhalatory
tests
were
monitored
by
means
of
a
whole
body
plethysmograph
free
range
run
was
used
for
the
exercise
test
and
the
peak
expiratory
flow
rate
was
measured
the
described
technique
of
inhalatory
tests
was
accurate
safe
and
not
tiring
for
the
patient
no
distinct
difference
in
bronchial
reaction
between
the
two
groups
of
patients
could
be
stated
the
bronchial
reaction
to
the
inhalatory
and
exercise
tests
was
stronger
in
both
groups
than
in
normals
but
not
as
strong
as
in
asthmatics
the
nature
of
bronchial
hyperreactivity
in
those
patients
is
still
unknown
the
inhalatory
test
seems
to
be
more
sensitive
than
the
exercise
test
in
detecting
that
hyperreactivity
