patients
and
control
subjects
previous
studies
have
shown
an
abnormality
of
the
spermidine
to
spermine
spd
spm
ratio
in
whole
blood
of
cystic
fibrosis
homo
and
heterozygotes
to
investigate
spd
and
spm
distribution
amoung
blood
components
as
a
possible
cause
of
the
abnormality
blood
was
fractionated
using
rabinowitz
s
glass
bead
technique
and
boyum
s
ficoll
hypaque
method
free
unconjugated
polyamines
were
extracted
with
perchloric
acid
and
quantitated
on
an
amino
acid
analyzer
in
controls
mean
sem
concentrations
in
nmoles
cells
of
spd
and
spm
respectively
were
and
for
erythrocytes
and
for
lymphocytes
and
for
granulocytes
and
less

less

nmoles
ml
for
plasma
when
converted
to
the
concentration
in
whole
blood
it
was
found
that
greater
than
of
spd
and
over
of
spm
was
associated
with
erythrocytes
while
the
higher
cellular
concentration
in
leukocytes
was
not
unexpected
the
fact
that
spd
and
spm
in
whole
blood
were
primarily
associated
with
erythrocytes
was
a
new
finding
comparison
with
controls
revealed
that
the
spd
spm
ratio
in
both
whole
blood
and
erythrocytes
was
significantly
higher
in
the
group
of
cystic

patients
