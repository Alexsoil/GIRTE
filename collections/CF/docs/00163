abnormal
thyroid
function
and
response
to
iodides
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
development
of
goiter
and
hypothyroidism
in
patients
receiving
chronic
iodide
therapy
indicates
that
they
have
underlying
thyroid
disease
in
dolan
and
gibson
in
a
retrospective
study
reviewed
the
records
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
receiving
chronic
expectorant
therapy
with
iodide
and
reported
that
approximately
percent
had
goiter
and
percent
suggestive
clinical
findings
of
hypothyroidism
this
study
together
with
the
fact
that
the
thyroid
like
lung
and
pancreas
is
of
endodermal
origin
raised
the
possibility
that
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
might
have
an
underlying
defect
in
thyroid
function
as
thyroid
function
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
has
not
been
evaluated
in
a
systematic
fashion
the
present
study
was
undertaken
in
it
we
have
evaluated
basal
thyroid
function
in
a
large
group
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
have
in
addition
observed
the
effects
of
chronic
iodide
administration
the
present
study
strongly
suggests
that
there
often
occurs
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
some
derangement
in
thyroid
hormone
economy
the
frequency
with
which
iodides
increased
serum
thyrotropin
decreased
serum
thyroxine
concentration
and
induced
goiter
with
or
without
hypothyroidism
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
points
strongly
to
the
presence
of
an
intrinsic
abnormality
of
the
thyroid
in
this
disease
the
nature
of
such
abnormality
remains
unclear
