describes
a
method
of
collecting
sweat

which
involves
placing
the

on
an
electric
blanket
and
wrapping
him
warmly
for
hours
until
profuse
sweating
has
occurred
for
minutes
one
important
omission
from
the
title

is
any
mention
of

develop
heat
prostration
when
exposed
to
high
temperatures
which
may
cause
massive
sodium
and
chloride
losses
via
the
sweat
this
could
occur
with
the
method
described
the
apparatus
described
by
gibson
and
cooke
in
the
classic
