cystic
fibrosis
is
an
autosomal
recessive
disease
usually
fatal
before
the
third
decade
characterized
by
chronic
obstructive
lung
disease
elevated
sweat
electrolyte
concentrations
and
pancreatic
insufficiency
the
present
investigation
was
carried
out
to
determine
if
p
type
serum
rnase
activity
was
reduced
in
cf
patients
to
years
of
age
no
difference
in
serum
rnase
activity
was
found
among
the
groups
of
normals
cf
patients
and
cf
heterozygotes
it
appears
that
observations
of
decreased
rnase
activity
in
the
serum
of
young
children
with
pancreatic
insufficiency
cannot
be
extended
to
older
children
at
least
without
withholding
pancreatic
supplements
