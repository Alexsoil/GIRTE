base
their
diagnosis
of
heterozygotes
and
homozygotes
for
cystic
fibrosis
on
the
thermal
stability
in
plasma
or
extracellular
fluids
of
alpha
mannosidase
and
or
phosphatase
activity
assayed
at
ph
the
activity
of
alpha
mannosidase
in
plasma
and
this
ph
is
a
composite
one
both
acidic
alpha
mannosidase
which
has
a
ph
optimum
of
and
intermediate
alpha
mannosidase
which
has
a
ph
optimum
of
will
contribute
to
the
activity
measured
at
ph
these
two
forms
of
alpha
mannosidase
are
structurally
and
genetically
distinct
and
have
different
kinetics
and
thermostabilities
therefore
the
total
alpha
mannosidase
activity
at
ph
and
the
physicochemical
properties
of
this
activity
will
depend
upon
the
relative
proportions
of
the
two
types
of
alpha
mannosidase
in
the
sample
the
proportions
of
the
two
forms
vary
widely
in
normal
plasma
especially
in
plasma
from
children
although
the
data
of
hosli
and
vogt
suggest
that
the
total
alpha
mannosidase
at
ph
does
not
differ
significantly
between
controls
cf
heterozygotes
and
cf
homozygotes
they
do
not
show
whether
the
proportions
of
acidic
and
intermediate
alpha
mannosidase
have
changed
an
increase
in
the
proportion
of
the
thermolabile
intermediate
alpha
mannosidase
in
cf
would
be
manifested
as
a
decreased
thermostability
of
alpha
mannosidase
at
ph
alternatively
a
mutation
in
the
normally
stable
acidic
alpha
mannosidase
leading
to
a
less
stable
form
would
also
be
reflected
as
a
decreased
stability
in
the
activity
at
ph
especially
if
the
proportion
of
acidic
alpha
mannosidase
was
increased
in
cf
these
situations
should
also
be
considered
as
possible
explanations
of
the
observations
in
addition
to
the
one
favoured
by
hosli
and
vogt
