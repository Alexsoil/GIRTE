evidence
for
an
impaired
glucagon
and
insulin
response
following
arginine
infusion
pancreatic
glucagon
and
insulin
were
determined
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
c
f
and
in
a
control
group
following
stimulation
by
an
arginine
infusion
in
controls
the
infusion
of
arginine
induced
a
prompt
threefold
elevation
in
plasma
pancreatic
glucagon
and
about
a
sixfold
increase
in
plasma
immunoreactive
insulin
in
patients
with
c
f
the
average
response
of
both
hormones
was
considerably
less
and
the
base
line
concentrations
for
glucagon
were
lower
the
data
support
the
hypothesis
that
in
c
f
both
alpha
and
beta
cell
function
are
affected
as
a
result
of
the
underlying
process
