understanding
of
genetic
risk
data
in
genetic
counseling
letter
relatively
little
has
been
published
on
the
parents
ability
to
grasp
the
importance
of
empirical
risk
data
and
mendelian
type
probabilities
the
basic
problem
is
that
for
many
reasons
consumers
do
not
know
what
the
recurrent
risks
are
for
the
various
genetic
diseases
not
only
cystic
fibrosis
as
is
so
often
the
problem
in
health
care
the
most
effective
means
to
communicate
health
care
information
is
not
used
or
even
known
until
the
problem
of
communication
of
probability
can
be
worked
out
i
would
like
to
make
some
suggestions
in
trying
to
help
those
who
are
provided
with
probability
data
always
record
probability
values
discussed
in
the
genetic
counseling
session
if
dealing
with
a
family
physician
the
information
should
become
a
part
of
the
medical
history
for
future
reference
when
providing
documentation
of
probabilities
always
include
the
interpretation
of
such
probabilities
through
diagrams
charts
and
other
simple
means
use
available
pamphlets
and
brochures
provided
by
various
organizations
such
as
foundations
and
departments
of
health
