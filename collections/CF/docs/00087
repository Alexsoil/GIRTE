radionuclide
evaluation
of
regional
lung
function
in
children
a
method
suitable
for
the
study
of
regional
lung
function
in
children
is
described
the
method
is
simple
to
perform
takes
only
min
and
provides
pictorial
and
numerical
information
on
regional
ventilation
and
perfusion
and
a
scaling
factor
measured
after
rebreathing
to
account
for
regional
variation
in
lung
size
and
shielding
although
the
availability
of
a
computer
system
such
as
the
one
described
in
the
text
is
essential
for
precise
and
rapid
numerical
evaluation
nuclear
medicine
laboratories
that
lack
this
facility
but
have
a
gamma
camera
could
use
this
method
to
obtain
scintigraphic
information
alone
