the
significance
of
the
sweat
test
in
chronic
pancreatitis
in
order
to
study
the
disposition
which
is
thought
to
be
latent
in
chronic
pancreatitis
we
investigated
the
sweat
chloride
concentration
of
normal
subjects
cases
of
chronic
pancreatitis
cases
of
cholelithiasis
cases
of
peptic
ulcers
cases
of
hepatic
diseases
and
cases
of
diabetes
mellitus
with
the
sweat
test
using
the
method
of
pilocarpine
iontophoresis
we
obtained
the
following
results
in
normal
subjects
the
sweat
chloride
concentration
was
inclined
to
rise
gradually
with
age
from
childhood
to
adulthood
the
mean
value
of
sweat
chloride
concentration
was
meq
liter
in
adults
from
years
old
and
the
upper
limit
was
about
meq
liter
the
mean
value
of
sweat
chloride
concentration
was
meq
liter
in
chronic
calcifying
pancreatitis
this
value
was
markedly
higher
than
that
of
control
subjects
of
the
same
age
p
is
less
than
the
mean
value
of
sweat
chloride
concentration
in
cholelithiasis
peptic
ulcer
and
hepatic
diseases
did
not
differ
significantly
from
control
subjects
the
mean
value
of
sweat
chloride
concentration
in
diabetes
mellitus
was
significantly
higher
than
that
of
control
subjects
p
is
less
than
but
was
significantly
lower
than
that
in
chronic
pancreatitis
p
is
less
than
it
was
supposed
that
some
cases
of
chronic
pancreatitis
have
a
congenital
disposition
toward
abnormal
secretion
of
sweat
glands
and
epithelium
in
the
pancreatic
duct
resembling
cystic
fibrosis
and
this
disposition
leads
easily
to
pancreatic
disorders
when
the
individual
is
exposed
to
various
external
factors
