a
phenotypic
characterization
of
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
from
single
sputum
samples
of
typical
cystic
fibrosis
patients
indicated
a
high
frequency
of
heterogeneity
among
isolates
on
the
basis
of
differences
in
antibiotic
resistance
colony
morphology
pigmentation
and
serotype
two
or
more
isolates
with
different
but
stable
susceptibilities
to
carnecillin
gentamycin
streptomycin
tetracycline
chloramphenicol
and
sulfamethoxazole
plus
trimethoprim
were
detected
in
of
the
sputa
differences
generally
were
independent
of
the
mucoid
state
of
the
strain
o
antigen
group
determination
with
the
difco
typing
set
showed
that
two
or
more
serologically
distinct
strains
were
present
in
sputum
specimens
nonmucoid
derivatives
of
mucoid
isolates
almost
always
retained
both
the
antibiotic
susceptibilities
and
serotype
of
their

these
data
suggest
that
cystic

patients
may
be
cocolonized
coinfected
by
difference
strains
of
p
aeruginosa
more
frequently
than
generally
believed
alternatively
phenotypically
distinct
strains
from
a
single
patient
might
arise
as
phenotypic
dissociants
from
a
single
infecting
strain
because
of
the
frequency
and
multiplicity
of
phenotypically
distinct
p
aeruginosa
isolates
which
we
obtained
from
our
cystic
fibrosis
patients
it
is
important
to
select
multiple
isolates
from
sputum
cultures
for
antimicrobial
susceptibility
testing
so
as
to
assess
adequately
the
susceptibility
of
this
organism
to
antibiotic
therapy
in
cystic
fibrosis
we
recommend
that
several
colonies
of
each
distinguishable
colony
type
of
p
aeruginosa
be
pooled
for
the
antibiogram
