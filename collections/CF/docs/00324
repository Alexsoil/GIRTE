olfactory
and
taste
sensitivity
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
psychophysical
experiments
measured
both
olfactory
sensitivity
to
butanol
and
sodium
chloride
and
taste
sensitivity
to
sodium
chloride
in
normal
children
and
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
sensitivity
of
the
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
fell
within
the
normal
range
these
results
stand
in
contrast
to
those
of
henkin
and
powell
who
found
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
to
be
hypersensitive
to
both
olfactory
and
taste
stimuli
apparent
hypersensitivity
to
taste
stimuli
could
have
resulted
from
the
adapting
effects
of
the
relatively
high
level
of
sodium
in
the
saliva
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
if
the
contaminating
effects
of
saliva
are
removed
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
yield
on
the
average
a
taste
threshold
identical
to
that
of
normal
children
there
appears
to
be
no
simple
explanation
for
why
henkin
and
powell
found
hypersensitivity
to
odorants
the
present
results
indicate
that
in
fact
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
display
a
slight
hyposensitivity
to
odorants
