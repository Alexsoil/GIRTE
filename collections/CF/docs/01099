bronchial
hyperreactivity
in
cystic
fibrosis
letter
mitchell
and
co
workers
conclude
that
bronchial
hyperreactivity
is
common
in
cystic
fibrosis
cf
but
is
different
from
that
in
asthma
their
data
were
interesting
but
i
do
not
agree
with
their
conclusion
one
can
interpret
these
data
as
suggesting
a
common
reversible
component
in
both
patient
groups
and
perhaps
a
common
denominator
in
mechanism
because
of
certain
problems
with
baseline
measurements
and
withholding
of
medication
it
seems
that
the
conclusion
of
mitchell
et
al
may
not
be
well
supported
we
felt
justified
in
studying
those
patients
with
a
low
baseline
fev
forced
expiratory
volume
in
one
second
since
a
subject
s
bronchial
response
to
methacholine
remains
stable
even
if
these
is
moderate
fluctuation
both
in
initial
specific
airway
conductance
and
in
the
severity
of
the
disease
we
feel
that
withholding
the
drug
for
a
longer
period
would
not
have
affected
the
comparisons
although
there
might
be
a
common
underlying
mechanism
in
bronchial
hyperreactivity
in
asthma
and
cystic
fibrosis
our
data
showed
a
number
of
differences
between
the
two
groups
of
patients
although
these
differences
would
not
exclude
a
common
mechanism
in
bronchial
hyperreactivity
in
the
two
diseases
the
existence
of
the
differences
should
lead
to
caution
in
concluding
that
there
is
a
common
underlying
mechanism
in
the
bronchial
hyperreactivity
in
the
two
diseases
