the
glycoprotein
degrading
potential
of
peripheral
leukocytes
in
cystic
fibrosis
in
this
study
the
potential
problems
and
discrepancies
in
cill
culture
techniques
were
avoided
by
isolating
leukocytes
from
the
peripheral
blood
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
healthy
human
volunteers
and
preparing
homogenates
to
determine
the
specific
activities
of
lysosomal
enzymes
involved
in
the
degradation
of
glycoproteins
four
lysosomal
hydrolases
involved
in
the
breakdown
of
the
carbohydrate
side
chain
were
assayed
using
artificial
substrates
the
fifth
enzyme
aspartylglucosamine
amido
hydrolase
which
cleaves
the
linkage
between
this
side
chain
and
the
peptide
backbone
was
assayed
with
natural
substrate
no
differences
in
enzyme
activities
between
the
leukocyte
sources
were
observed
because
no
enzyme
activities
were
deficient
and
no
compensatory
increases
were
noted
we
concluded
that
the
thick
glycoprotein
rich
exocrine
secretions
in
cystic
fibrosis
cannot
be
attributed
to
a
defect
in
their
catabolism
