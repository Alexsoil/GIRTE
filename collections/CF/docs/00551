cystic
fibrosis
a
new
challenge
for
the
patient
care
team
to
date
most
cases
of
cystic
fibrosis
have
been
treated
in
pediatric
hospitals
with
changes
and
advances
in
treatment
patients
who
were
once
considered
terminally
ill
are
now
living
into
adulthood
the
stresses
that
result
from
chronic
illness
are
considered
herein
from
the
standpoint
of
the
social
caseworker
who
plans
a
crucial
role
on
the
patient
care
team
new
problems
regarding
the
personal
development
of
the
patient
are
presented
with
particular
emphasis
on
the
role
of
a
cf
patient
as
a
parent
the
role
of
the
respiratory
therapist
in
the
care
of
such
patients
is
unique
this
is
due
to
the
extensiveness
of
patient
contact
both
verbal
and
physical
and
to
the
primary
threat
that
pulmonary
disease
poses
to
the
patient
with
cf
the
therapist
s
ability
to
cope
with
the
problem
while
aiding
the
family
and
patient
to
do
the
same
becomes
crucial
to
the
child
s
rehabilitation
the
requirements
for
fulfilling
this
role
are
educational
and
developmental
in
nature
and
should
be
pursued
as
a
model
for
future
patient
care
