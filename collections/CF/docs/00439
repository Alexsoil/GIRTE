mucous
glycoproteins
pp
early
investigators
employed
histochemical
chemical
and
physiochemical
techniques
in
an
attempt
to
identify
differences
between
cystic
fibrosis
and
control
mucous
secretions
several
mucous
glycoprotein
abnormalities
were
suggested
by
their
studies
in
retrospect
none
of
these
studies
achieved
their
goal
of
describing
a
fundamental
mucous
glycoprotein
abnormality
peculiar
to
cf
improved
methods
have
been
devised
for
the
collection
of
mucous
glycoproteins
in
human
respiratory
tract
secretions
and
the
study
of
their
chemical
and
physical
properties
therefore
it
is
now
possible
to
make
preliminary
comparisons
between
human
tracheobronchial
mucous
glycoproteins
from
cf
and
non
cf
sources
general
properties
of
mucous
glycoproteins
human
tracheobronchial
mucous
glycoproteins
comparison
of
cf
and
non
cf
tracheobronchial
mucous
glycoprotein
and
suggested
directions
for
future
studies
of
cf
mucous
secretions
are
discussed
