the
effectiveness
and
safety
of
tobramycin
against
infections
due
to
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
were
studied
in
patients
with
moderate
to
severe
exacerbation
of
chronic
pulmonary
infection
seventeen
courses
of
treatment
were
given
tobramycin
mg
kg
per
day
was
administered
intravenously
in
three
divided
doses
per
day
seven
to
days
all
specimens
of
sputum
yielded
moderate
to
heavy
growth
of
p
aeruginosa
all
isolates
were
inhibited
by
mug
of
tobramycin
ml
and
in
seven
cases
isolates
were
not
inhibited
by
mug
of
gentamicin
ml
the
mean
levels
of
tobramycin
in
the
blood
were
mug
ml
hr
and
mug
ml
hr
after
administration
all
patients
received
an
antistaphylococcal
agent
before
during
and
after
therapy
all
patients
except
for
two
received
mg
of
carbenicillin
kg
per
day
intravenously
in
six
divided
doses
and
g
of
carbenicillin
in
a
mask
for
inhalation
three
times
a
day
both
clinical
and
radiological
improvement
was
noted
in
all
patients
the
white
blood
cell
count
which
was
elevated
in
seven
patients
returned
to
normal
and
levels
of
blood
gases
improved
p
aeruginosa
was
eliminated
from
the
sputum
in
five
cases
no

side
effects
were
noted
