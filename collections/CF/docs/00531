high

are
made
on
the

of
rabbit

cilia
with
the
aid
of

optics
the
detailed
nature
of
the
ciliary

pattern
is
determined
from
slow
motion
analysis
of
the
high

cinemicrographs
such
documented
forms
of
ciliary
beat
pattern
and
the
physiologic
state
of
the
tracheal
epithelia
are
utilized
as
basic
reference
controls
to
investigate
the
physiologic
effects
of
cystic

serum
on

and
the

phenomenon
careful
analyses
of
the
high

cinemicrographs
reveal
that
cystic

serum
has
no
effect
on
the
rhythm
and
beat
pattern
of
rabbit
tracheal
cilia
however
it
is
shown
in
controlled
procedures
that
cystic
fibrosis
serum
has
a
cytolytic
effect
on
the
tracheal
epithelial
cells
and
also
at
the
cell
junctions
ciliary
dyskinesis
as
described
in
previous
reports
is
actually
a
secondary
effect
of
cytolysis
and
cell
destruction
