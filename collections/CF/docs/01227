the
bacteriological
effect
of
chemotherapy
against
pseudomonas

ps
ae
in
lungs
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
is
reviewed
during
a
year
period
children
and
adults
were
treated
with
courses
of
different
antibiotics
the
mucoid
strains
of
ps
ae
disappeared
in
of
the
courses
in
which
a
combination
of
tobramycin
and
carbenicillin
was
employed
tobramycin
given
alone
had
only
bacteriological
effect
in
of
the
courses
colimycin
alone
or
in
combination
with
carbenicillin
had
no
effect
in
patients
who
received
subsequent
courses
of
tobramycin
and
combination
of
tobramycin
and
carbenicillin
a

therapy
was
found
also
in
