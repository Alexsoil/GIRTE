in

a
comprehensive
study
of

s

s
rrna
methylation
in
human
fibroblasts
is
presented
cells
from
normal
volunteers
and
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
were
examined
during
exponential
growth
by
incubation
with
l
methyl
c
methionine
and
h
uridine
the
ratio
of
c
to
h
counts
per
minute
in
isolated
rna
serves
as
a
measure
of
the
extent
of
methylation
and
was
found
to
be
similar
in
normal
and
cf
fibroblasts
for
trna
s
rrna

hydrolyzed
samples
of

species
were
analyzed
by

and

the
methylated
base
and

compositions
of

agree

with

rna
methylation
patterns
in

were
qualitatively

quantitatively
similar
to
those
observed
in

for

there
is
no
evidence
that

species
from

are
deficient
in
any

components
methylation
of
rna
by
tissue
cultured
cells
from

is
qualitatively
and
quantitatively
normal
and
will
not
prove
to
be
a
useful
marker
for
