zinc
deficiency
syndrome
in
a
british
youth
with
cystic
fibrosis
a
syndrome
of
dwarfism
and
retarded
sexual
development
among
iranian
and
egyptian
teenage
boys
has
been
shown
to
be
due
to
zinc
deficiency
a
british
patient
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
nephrotic
syndrome
showed
growth
retardation
and
hypogonadism
associated
with
low
plasma
zinc
concentrations
the
combination
of
cystic
fibrosis
and
nephrotic
syndrome
appears
to
be
fortuitous
and
undoubtedly
adverse
effects
on
zinc
homoeostasis
were
cumulative
nevertheless
zinc
deficiency
should
be
considered
when
somatic
and
sexual
growth
failure
occur
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
