malabsorption
of
zinc
iron
and
manganese
in
exocrine
pancreatic
insufficiency
has
been
demonstrated
by
these
early
studies
a
possible
relationship
between
this
and
the
associated
features
of
cf
has
been
briefly
discussed
and
indicates
areas
for
further
research
if
such
relationships
are
established
then
some
form
of
trace
element
supplementation
should
be
considered
