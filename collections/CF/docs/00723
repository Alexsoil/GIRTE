pathophysiology
of
diseases
involving
intestinal
brush
border
proteins
the
intestinal
brush
border
is
a
complex
organelle
that
contains
hydrolytic
enzymes
receptors
other
proteins
involved
in
transport
and
contractile
proteins
in
this
article
we
review
the
molecular
organization
of
brush
border
proteins
within
the
whole
membrane
and
discuss
their
synthesis
and
turnover
this
knowledge
provides
a
framework
for
understanding
the
mechanisms
by
which
certain
diseases
are
associated
with
changes
in
brush
border
proteins
