essential

in

the
nature
of
the
metabolic
defect
in
cystic
fibrosis
cf
has
to
date
not
been
elucidated
elliott
reported
that
intravenous
administration
of
soybean
oil
and
lecithin
to
children
suffering
from
cf
caused
their
sweat
sodium
concentration
to
decrease
towards
normal
values
this
prompted
us
to
investigate
the
fatty
acid
spectra
of
the
various
serum
lipid
classes
of
children
with
cf
we
have
found
that
affected
children
are
deficient
in
essential
fatty
acids
the
data
suggest
another
approach
to
the
study
of
the
metabolic
defect
in
cystic
fibrosis
there
is
an
apparent
deficiency
in
essential
fatty
acids
and
a
marked
reduction
in
serum
vitamin
e
levels
has
also
been
reported
in
cf
these
conditions
might
be
partially
corrected
by
intravenous
injection
or
possibly
feeding
of
lipids
containing
essential
fatty
acids
with
concomitant
administration
of
vitamin
e
the
observed
deficiency
in
essential
fatty
acids
may
be
produced
by
a
reduced
ability
to
absorb
these
acids
from
the
diet
and
this
in
turn
may
result
in
defects
in
membrane
structure
or
stability
reduced
levels
of
vitamin
e
in
cf
may
reflect
a
reduced
requirement
for
this
vitamin
because
of
the
lower
levels
of
essential
fatty
acids
it
is
also
possible
that
the
observed
deficiency
in
serum
levels
of
essential
fatty
acids
may
lead
to
less
than
normal
production
of
prostaglandins
