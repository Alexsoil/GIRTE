cystic

serum
promotes
ca
uptake
by
normal
human
leukocytes
a
two
fold
increase
in
ca
labeling
was
observed
when
normal
human
leukocytes
were
incubated
in
the
presence
of
serum
obtained
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
degree
of
ca
labeling
of
leukocytes
isolated
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
was
also
significantly
greater
than
that
observed
for
leukocytes
that
had
been
isolated
from
normal
individuals
