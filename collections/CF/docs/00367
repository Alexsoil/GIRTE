polymorphism
studies
of
sera
and
duodenal
aspirates
in
normal
individuals
and
in
cystic
fibrosis
prior
genetic
studies
of
the
human
pancreatic
amylase
amy
locus
have
been
directed
principally
to
the
electrophoretic
analysis
of
serum
and
urine
on
the
assumption
that
these
fluids
receive
negligible
contributions
from
the
salivary
amy
locus
in
support
of
that
assumption
was
the
observation
that
the
isozyme
bands
were
lacking
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
in
a
postpancreatectomy
patient
we
have
examined
the
sera
of
patients
having
cystic
fibrosis
and
find
normal
levels
of
serum
amylase
on
electrophoresis
three
quarters
of
the
cystic
fibrosis
patients
have
a
pattern
f
pattern
not
observed
in
normal
sera
the
pattern
is
characterized
by
the
absence
of
pa
comparative
electrophoresis
and
mixing
experiments
indicate
that
the
f
pattern
is
of
salivary
origin
and
is
unmasked
in
cystic
fibrosis
by
the
absence
of
a
pancreatic
contribution
the
normal
serum
pattern
is
considered
to
be
an
admixture
of
salivary
and
pancreatic
amylase
on
the
assumption
that
duodenal
fluids
might
more
closely
reflect
the
pancreatic
amy
locus
electrophoretic
studies
were
performed
on
normal
individuals
and
individuals
with
cystic
fibrosis
electrophoretic
phenotypes
in
duodenal
aspirates
are
more
complex
than
previously
reported
in
studies
of
urine
and
serum
presumably
because
of
the
higher
concentrations
of
amylase
in
the
aspirates
comparative
electrophoresis
and
mixing
experiments
indicate
that
the
phenotypes
observed
in
duodenal
aspirates
also
reflect
admixture
of
pancreatic
and
salivary
amylase
this
recognition
of
pancreatic
and
salivary
admixture
in
sera
fortunately
does
not
alter
our
prior
understanding
of
the
genetics
of
the
amy
polymorphism
the
extensive
studies
which
led
to
the
delineation
of
the
amy
polymorphism
were
essentially
based
on
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
variant
band
which
proves
now
to
be
outside
the
zone
of
admixture
