pulmonary
hypertension
offers
us
a
complex
pattern
of
structural
and
functional
interaction
we
are
just
beginning
to
realize
how
complex
it
is
information
on
normal
structure
its
modification
and
remodeling
by
growth
and
disease
and
appropriate
techniques
are
available
that
will
enable
us
to
formulate
our
questions
with
due
regard
for
anatomic
precision
and
functional
implication
and
so
research
will
lead
to
understanding
and
it
can
be
expected
to
control
of
the
undesirable
aspects

pulmonary
hypertension
