clinico
pathological
evaluation
of
cases
of
cystic
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
in
infancy
at
necropsy
the
clinical
and
morphological
findings
of
cases
of
cystic
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
from
full
but
non
consecutive
necropsies
are
presented
all
of
these
cases
were
diagnosed
at
post
mortem
examination
the
autopsy
incidence
was
and
none
of
the
cases
was
beyond
two
years
of
age
morphological
findings
revealed
varying
severities
in
organ
involvement
in
all
cases
with
absence
of
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
in
some
in
only
two
cases
histopathological
changes
seemed
to
be
confined
to
the
pancreas
this
study
suggests
that
cystic
fibrosis
plays
a
considerable
role
in
infant
deaths
in
our
country
and
in
most
if
not
all
cases
the
diagnosis
must
necessarily
be
based
on
postmortem
studies
