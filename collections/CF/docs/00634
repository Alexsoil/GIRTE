early
prenatal
diagnosis
of

the
combined
use
of
special
cell
culture
techniques
and
biochemical
ultramicromethods
permits
one
to
handle
very
small
amounts
of
materials
to
reduce
the
costs
of
chemicals
and
more
accurately
to
assess
gene
dosage
effects
by

per

instead
of
per

protein
an
alkaline

induction
test
has
been
developed
which
allows
one
to
screen
small

of

for
lysosomal

a
successful
attempt
has
been
made
to
automate
the
microtechniques
combining
the
alkaline
phosphatase
induction
with
the
ultramicro
automatization
should
eventually
permit
one
to
screen
all

automated

should
contribute
to
