cystic
fibrosis
cystic
fibrosis
is
the
most
frequent
lethal
genetic
syndrome
among
white
children
and
is
the
cause
of
much
of
the
chronic
progressive
pulmonary
disease
encountered
in
children
because
of
the
increasing
adolescent
and
adult
population
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
their
psychosocial
employment
and
treatment
needs
this
review
whenever
possible
will
emphasize
aspects
pertinent
to
older
patients
no
known
biochemical
or
structural
defect
will
account
for
all
the
pathophysiologic
phenomena
of
cystic
fibrosis
thus
the
definition
of
the
disease
rests
on
the
clinical
findings
cystic
fibrosis
is
a
syndrome
and
not
yet
a
disease
incidence
figures
for
cystic
fibrosis
are
necessarily
minimal
the
best
diagnostic
efforts
currently
available
fail
to
detect
all
those
who
die
at
a
young
age
or
who
have
mild
symptoms
several
pieces
of
evidence
indicate
that
cystic
fibrosis
is
transmitted
as
an
autosomal
recessive
trait
an
autosomal
recessive
inheritance
for
cystic
fibrosis
suggests
a
discrete
biochemical
or
structural
defect
to
date
no
single
lesion
has
been
proved
to
provide
a
unifying
hypothesis
for
the
pathophysiology
of
cystic
fibrosis
exocrine
gland
dysfunction
mucociliary
transport
immunology
ciliary
factors
and
transport
mechanisms
are
discussed
the
manifestations
of
cystic
fibrosis
involve
many
organ
systems
and
the
pattern
of
presentation
is
variable
respiratory
gastrointestinal
genitourinary
and
sweat
gland
manifestations
are
discussed
there
are
at
least
possible
approaches
to
screening
for
cystic
fibrosis
sweat
testing
evaluation
of
pancreatic
function
or
detection
of
some
product
of
the
defective
gene
prenatal
diagnosis
and
heterozygote
testing
diagnosis
in
adults
and
diagnostic
problems
are
also
examined
treatment
includes
prevention
pulmonary
therapy
and
gastrointestinal
therapy
pulmonary
and
other
complications
and
their
treatment
are
discussed
as
well
as
psychosocial
aspects
and
evaluation
and
prognosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
