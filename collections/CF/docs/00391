decreased
formation
of
alpha
macroglobulin
protease
complexes
in
plasma
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
alpha
macroglobulin
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
is
shown
to
have
reduced
binding
with
papain
trypsin
and
thrombin
the
obligate
heterozygotes
for
cystic
fibrosis
revealed
intermediate
values
between
the
controls
and
the
patients
since
papain
and
trypsin
are
not
plasma
endopeptidases
it
becomes
evident
that
the
absence
of
alpha
macroglobulin
protease
complex
in
cystic
fibrosis
is
due
to
a
molecular
defect
within
the
macroglobulin
