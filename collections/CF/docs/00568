cystic
fibrosis
cf
is
a
common
inherited
disorder
which
is
characterized
by
the
production
of
exocrine
secretions
with
elevated
ion
content
and
abnormally
viscous
mucus
over
the
last
few
years
cells
obtained
from
the
peripheral
blood
or
cultured
from
tissues
of
cystic
fibrosis
patients
have
been
used
increasingly
in
the
study
of
the
disease
investigations
