mucosal

activity
in

disease
jejunal
biopsy
specimens
were
obtained
from
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
celiac
disease
cd
or
congenital
exocrine
pancreatic
hypoplasia
ceph
and
from
control
subjects
sections
were
examined
histologically
and
homogenates
were
used
for
measurement
of
enterokinase
and
sucrase
activities
this
work
was
undertaken
because
enterokinase
is
considered
a
brush
border
enzyme
the
release
of
which
into
the
intestinal
lumen
is
influenced
by
pancreatic
enzymes
and
also
because
we
have
recently
shown
a
small
bowel
mucosal
dysfunction
in
patients
with
cf
as
expected
sucrase
activity
was
reduce
p
in
children
with
cd
as
compared
to
the
other
three
groups
on
the
other
hand
enterokinase
activity
in
children
with
pancreatic
insufficiency
cf
and
ceph
was
higher
p
than
that
of
control
subjects
the
present
study
has
shown
that
in
patients
with
cf
and
ceph
mucosal
enterokinase
activity
was
increased
as
compared
to
control
subjects
it
seems
that
the
pancreatic
enzymes
play
a
large
role
in
the
turnover
of
enzymes
in
the
brush
border
membrane
and
that
the
observed
increase
of
mucosal
enterokinase
activity
is
probably
explained
by
a
reduced
degradation
in
patients
with
exocrine
pancreatic
insufficiency
