presenting

syndrome
the
meconium
plug
syndrome
mps
is
a
common
cause
of
low
intestinal
obstruction
in
newborn
infants
usually
it
is
benign
and
not
associated
with
other
intestinal
dysfunction
we
describe
the
cases
of
three
infants
in
whom
there
was
intestinal
obstruction
consistent
with
the
mps
and
in
which
cystic
fibrosis
cf
was
later
documented
we
suggest
that
there
is
an
association
between
the
mps
and
cf
and
that
the
condition
of
all
infants
with
the
mps
be
evaluated
for
the
possibility
of
both
hirschsprung
s
disease
and
cf
