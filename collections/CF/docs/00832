editorial
the
fact
that
a
serum
factor
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
inhibits
ciliary
movement
of
cells
of
isolated
tracheae
and
the
observation
that
ciliary
movement
is
associated
with
pinocytotic
activity
led
ohno
et
al
to
suggest
that
this
defect
is
responsible
for
aplasia
or
hypoplasia
of
the
wolffian
duct
structures
in
males
with
cystic
fibrosis
while
ohno
s
hypothesis
lacks
definitive
proof
the
hypoplasia
or
aplasia
of
the
vas
in
males
with
cystic
fibrosis
is
extremely
common
producing
sterility
in
affected
males
