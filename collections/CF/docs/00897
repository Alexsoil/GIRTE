iatrogenic
hyperuricemia
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
we
report
the
frequent
presence
of
hyperuricemia
in
a
group
of
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
who
were
known
to
be
consuming
large
dosages
of
pancreatic
extract
as
part
of
their
therapy
hyperuricemia
was
more
common
in
older
patients
who
had
been
treated
for
a
longer
period
of
time
clarification
of
the
role
of
renal
function
and
other
factors
in
the
production
of
hyperuricemia
awaits
a
careful
study
of
the
relationship
of
purine
load
to
urate
excretion
at
various
ages
in
these
patients
