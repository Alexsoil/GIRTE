heterozygote
disadvantage
in
cystic
fibrosis
letter
i
have
found
that
cystic
fibrosis
c
f
which
is
very
common
in
south
west
africa
occurs
almost
exclusively
in
white
afrikaners
probably
as
a
result
of
inbreeding
the
drift
from
the
northern
cape
colony
and
religious
and
geographical
separation
however
i
have
not
found
c
f
in
the
descendants
of
the
angola
boers
a
small
proportion
of
the
white
population
who
belong
to
a
small
branch
of
the
dutch
reformed
church
the
absence
of
c
f
may
stem
from
their
limited
numbers
but
i
suggest
that
it
may
have
at
least
partially
a
genetic
basis
homozygotes
with
c
f
are
subject
to
salt
losing
crises
which
can
be
fatal
in
hot
weather
and
heterozygotes
often
have
an
increased
concentration
of
sodium
and
chlorine
ions
in
their
sweat
the
influence
of
environmental
temperature
and
drought
may
explain
why
c
f
occurs
among
blacks
in
temperate
zones
of
the
united
states
but
not
in
africa
and
is
less
frequent
in
the
hot
southern
regions
of
europe
than
in
the
colder
more
northern
areas
negative
selection
of
this
type
may
have
operated
only
in
hot
arid
environments
and
the
possibility
that
other
environments
offered
advantages
to
c
f
heterozygotes
cannot
be
excluded
