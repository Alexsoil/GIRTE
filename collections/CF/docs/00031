influence
of
mist
tent
therapy
on
sputum
viscosity
and
water
content
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
hypothesis
that
mist
tent
therapy
decreases
the
viscosity
of
sputum
by
direct
liquefaction
of
the
sputum
in
the
lower
respiratory
tract
was
tested
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
the
first
night
all
patients
slept
without
the
mist
tent
and
the
first
morning
sputum
was
collected
for
analysis
the
following
nights
patients
were
randomly
allocated
to
a
tent
supplied
by
either
a
jet
or
ultrasonic
nebulizer
the
early
morning
sputum
was
analysed
for
volume
viscosity
water
content
and
dna
content
an
index
of
purulence
there
was
no
relation
between
sputum
viscosity
and
dna
content
water
content
or
volume
furthermore
there
was
no
consistent
relation
between
sputum
viscosity
or
volume
expectorated
and
the
presence
or
absence
of
an
hour
stay
in
the
tent
with
either
method
of
water
nebulization
these
results
therefore
suggest
that
mist
therapy
does
not
consistently
influence
sputum
viscosity
or
volume
in
patients
with
cf
above
a
sputum
water
content
of
further
increases
in
water
content
do
not
influence
viscosity
