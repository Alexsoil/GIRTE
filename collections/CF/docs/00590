infection
in
cystic
fibrosis
diagnostic
and
prognostic
significance
of
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
precipitins
determined
by
means
of
crossed
immunoelectrophoresis
a
survey
the
purpose
of
the
first
part
of
the
present
work
is
to
review
the
literature
concerning
the
lower
respiratory
tract
infections
and
the
antimicrobial
resistance
mechanisms
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
the
second
part
of
the
work
deals
with
the
most
important
therapeutical
problem
in
cystic
fibrosis
today
viz
the
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
lung
infection
a
survey
is
made
of
the
investigations
of
the
present
author
and
his
colleagues
into
the
immune
response
against
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
infection
and
the
literature
concerning
these
subjects
furthermore
the
possible
mechanisms
of
tissue
damage
in
the
respiratory
tract
of
cystic
fibrosis
patients
during
these
infections
are
discussed
