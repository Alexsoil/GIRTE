a
number
of
investigations
have
been
used
for
the
first
time
to
examine
the
secretory
iga
siga
system
in
different
body
fluids
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
free

chain
was
detected
in
all
the
sputum
specimens
examined
the
isolated
free
secretory
component
sc
from
cf
sputum
differed
in
electrophoretic
mobility
from
the
sc
isolated
from
normal
human
colostrum
in
addition
the
free
sc
from
some
cf
saliva
formed
precipitin
lines
of
partial
identity
with
normal
human
saliva
or
colostrum
a
higher
proportion
of

sera
than
of
normal

contained

these
investigations
suggest
that
there
may
be
some
defect
in
the
synthesis
and
or
the
assembly
of
the
siga
immunoglobulins
which
if
confirmed
may
help
to
explain
