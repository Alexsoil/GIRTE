oral
zinc
supplementation
with
mg
zinc
sulfate
over
an
week
period
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
siblings
did
not
affect
the

as

significant
quantitative
changes
in

zinc
appear
to

to

the
lack
of
response
to
zinc
supplementation
might
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
group
of

subjects
studied
was

in
