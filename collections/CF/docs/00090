mists
and
aerosols
new
studies
new
thoughts
the
recent
data
suggest
that
we
can
no
longer
use
mist
tents
or
intermittent
aerosol
therapy
for
cystic
fibrosis
patients
with
the
abandon
previously
employed
we
cannot
accept
such
therapy
as
having
been
proved
to
be
effective
we
formerly
believed
aerosols
and
mists
could
do
little
harm
we
now
know
they
can
be
harmful
if
such
treatment
is
to
be
used
the
patient
should
be
closely
monitored
clinically
and
with
sensitive
pulmonary
function
tests
such
as
maximum
expiratory
flow
volume
curves
it
is
obvious
that
we
have
much
more
to
learn
confirm
or
disprove
with
respect
to
the
rationale
for
and
benefits
of
mist
and
aerosol
therapy
