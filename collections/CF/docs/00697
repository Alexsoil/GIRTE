false
negative
meconium
test
results
in
screening
for
cystic
fibrosis
the
value
of
the
boehringer
mannheim
b
m
meconium
test
for
routine
screening
for
cystic
fibrosis
has
been
questioned
recently
because
of
the
high
proportion
of
false
negative
results
this
report
presents
our
observations
on
the
validity
of
the
b
m
meconium
test
our
findings
show
that
the
b
m
meconium
test
may
contribute
to
false
negative
results
even
when
the
exocrine
pancreatic
function
of
a
newborn
infant
with
cf
is
abnormal
our
observation
supports
the
doubts
expressed
recently
in
regard
to
the
validity
of
the
b
m
meconium
test
in
screening
neonates
for
cystic
fibrosis
