reliability
of
sweat
test
in
cystic
fibrosis
letter
the
report
by
huff
huang
and
arey
again
calls
attention
to
the
heterogeneity
of
cystic
fibrosis
and
to
the
fact
that
a
properly
performed
sweat
test
in
the
normal
or
borderline
range
does
not
rule
out
cystic
fibrosis
this
may
occur
in
approximately
of
patients
we
classify
as
having
cystic
fibrosis
and
confirms
our
original
impression
that
the
sweat
test
has
a
reliability
of
between
and
one
must
pay
close
attention
to
the
clinical
picture
the
family
history
and
especially
the
pulmonary
or
gastrointestinal
findings
and
provide
rational
treatment
until
more
acceptable
evidence
of
the
disease
can
be
documented
in
the
same
issue
is
a
report
on
a
false
positive
sweat
test
in
a
canadian
patient
with
the
mauriac
syndrome
the
authors
list
a
variety
of
conditions
that
have
been
reported
as
yielding
elevated
sweat
electrolytes
the
manner
of
the
collections
can
greatly
influence
the
result
in
patients
with
transient
abnormal
sweat
electrolytes
sodium
values
were
consistently
higher
than
chloride
values
perhaps
the
finding
of
sodium
values
in
excess
of
chloride
in
the
abnormal
range
suggests
a
false
positive
test
