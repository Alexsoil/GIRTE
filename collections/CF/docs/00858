metabolic
cooperation
of
a
group
of
danish
cf
patients
and
their
families
were
studied
to
determine
the
distribution
of
the
two
cf
culture
classes
and
their
prognostic
significance
of
these
were
class
i
class
ii
and
were
proposed
to
be
genetic
compounds
the
occurrence
of
class
ii
was
twice
that
found
in
a
group
of
patients
from
new
york
and
minnesota
the
prognosis
for
class
ii
cf
patients
was
considered
to
be
poorer
as
the
initial
diagnosis
was
made
earlier
in
class
ii
than
in
class
i
or
the
compounds
of
class
ii
were
diagnosed
in

of
life
as
compared
to
in

and
of
the
compounds
only
of
the
class

patients
survived
over
the
age
of
years
both
being
deceased
at

of
the
study
in
whereas
of
class
i
and
of
the

were
over
years
at
the
end
of
the
study
this
research
added
further
evidence
for
