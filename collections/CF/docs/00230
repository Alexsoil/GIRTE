polyamine
alterations
in
blood
of
male
homozygotes
and
heterozygotes
for
cystic
fibrosis
the
polyamines
spermidine
and
spermine
have
been
measured
in
whole
blood
extracts
from
control
volunteers
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
obligate
cystic
fibrosis
heterozygotes
male
homo
and
heterozygotes
for
cystic
fibrosis
exhibit
a
consistent
and
significant
decrease
in
blood
spermine
resulting
in
an
elevated
spermidine
spermine
ratio
when
compared
to
control
males
in
contrast
control
females
exhibited
reduced
spermidine
and
spermine
levels
as
compared
to
control
males
blood
from
female
cystic
fibrosis
homo
and
heterozygotes
showed
similar
results
the
sex
difference
is
probably
due
to
fluctuations
of
blood
polyamines
during
the
menstrual
cycle
abnormal
polyamine
levels
are
the
first
observation
of
an
alteration
of
a
low
molecular
weight
metabolite
characteristic
of
both
male
homo
and
heterozygotes
for
cystic
fibrosis
