present
status
of
intrauterine
diagnosis
of
genetic
defects
prenatal
diagnosis
of
genetic
disorders
has
received
increasing
attention
during
the
past
several
years
rapid
expansion
of
our
knowledge
of
the
basis
of
genetic
disease
and
the
development
of
reliable
diagnostic
methods
have
led
to
rapid
advances
in
the
intrauterine
diagnosis
of
a
large
number
of
inherited
disorders
prenatal
diagnosis
was
initially
used
to
determine
the
presence
of
down
s
syndrome
and
other
chromosomal
abnormalities
and
for
the
determination
of
fetal
sex
in
pregnancies
at
risk
for
a
number
of
severe
x
linked
recessive
disorders
shortly
thereafter
it
became
clear
that
the
same
techniques
could
be
applied
to
the
prenatal
diagnosis
of
a
number
of
the
inborn
errors
of
metabolism
most
recently
a
number
of
new
techniques
have
been
developed
that
may
prove
to
be
of
great
value
in
the
prenatal
diagnosis
of
a
number
of
severe
congenital
malformations
that
before
now
could
not
be
diagnosed
prior
to
birth
the
goal
of
this
review
is
to
define
the
past
achievements
future
goals
and
present
limitations
of
intrauterine
diagnosis
the
first
section
will
deal
with
the
general
approaches
used
in
prenatal
diagnosis
of
genetic
disorders
this
will
be
followed
by
a
discussion
of
the
specific
applications
of
the
basic
techniques
to
the
intrauterine
diagnosis
of
chromosomal
abnormalities
and
of
the
inborn
errors
of
metabolism
approaches
to
prenatal
diagnosis
of
genetic
disorders
include
amniocentesis
direct
and
indirect
visualization
of
the
fetus
analysis
of
maternal
blood
and
urine
and
sampling
of
fetal
tissues
applications
of
prenatal
genetic
diagnosis
include
x
linked
recessive
disorders
chromosomal
abnormalities
inborn
errors
of
metabolism
disorders
of
lipid
metabolism
disorders
of
carbohydrate
metabolism
disorders
of
mucopolysaccharide
metabolism
disorders
of
amino
acid
metabolism
and
miscellaneous
disorders
such
as
cystic
fibrosis
these
techniques
provide
some
parents
with
methods
for
having
children
without
fear
of
having
a
child
with
a
specific
deformity
in
addition
to
the
development
of
approaches
which
will
increase
the
number
of
disorders
detectable
in
utero
the
potential
for
treatment
of
genetic
disorders
is
unlimited
