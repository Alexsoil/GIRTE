quantitative
evaluation
of
serum
pancreatic
isoamylases
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
amylase
in
sera
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
of
the
pancreas
cfp
of
whom
had
pancreatic
insufficiency
pi
and
of
normal
control
subjects
was
separated
into
its
pancreatic
and
salivary
components
and
quantitated
electrophoretic
separation
was
achieved
on
polyacrylamide
disc
gels
with
subsequent
sectioning
of
the
gel
columns
the
amylase
content
in
international
units
per
liter
iu
l
was
obtained
for
each
section
by
the
insoluble
blue
starch
substrate
method
the
mean
total
serum
amylase
of
the
cfp
patients
with
pi
was
significantly
lower
than
the
control
group
a
highly
significant
decrease
was
found
when
the
pancreatic
isoamylase
was
considered
alone
the
salivary
isoamylase
level
remained
essentially
the
same
three
patients
with
cfp
but
without
pi
demonstrated
higher
than
normal
pancreatic
amylase
values
in
the
serum
these
patients
may
be
in
an
early
stage
of
a
progressive
involvement
of
the
pancreas
in
which
there
is
an
increased
release
of
amylase
this
method
of
electrophoretic
separation
and
quantitation
of
the
serum
amylase
is
sensitive
and
efficient
and
allows
the
simultaneous
processing
of
multiple
specimens
the
results
obtained
agree
with
previously
published
ratios
of
serum
isoamylases
our
method
should
be
valuable
in
the
study
of
other
diseases
of
the
exocrine
pancreas
and
salivary
glands
