in
cystic

a
false
positive
in
labeled
leukocyte
scan
was
obtained
in
a
girl
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
infection
there
was
focal
accumulation
of
in
activity
in
the
abdomen
and
marked
pulmonary
uptake
surgical
exploration
and
postmortem
examination
revealed
no
abdominal
abnormality
the
abnormal
activity
was
apparently
due
to
swallowed
sputum
which
contained
labeled
leukocytes
broader
clinical
implications
are
discussed
