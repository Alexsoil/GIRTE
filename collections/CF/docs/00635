differential
serum
amylase
determination
by
use
of
an
inhibitor
and
design
of
a
routine
procedure
we
describe
a
new
method
for
measuring
pancreatic
and
salivary
type
amylases
in
serum
that
requires
no
electrophoresis
or
chromatography
an
inhibitor
protein
from
wheat
with
a
fold
greater
specificity
for
human
salivary
than
for
human
pancreatic
amylase
was
used
to
analyze
mixtures
of
the
two
enzymes
the
concentration
of
pancreatic
and
salivary
amyalase
was
determined
in
normal
sera
men
and
women
statistically
significant
differences
were
found
for
serum
pancreatic
amylase
between
mean
and
women
higher
values
being
shown
in
women
no
sex
related
difference
was
found
for
the
salivary
component
of
serum
amylase
with
this
method
the
increase
in
serum
amylase
activity
in
pancreatitis
was
shown
to
be
attributable
to
the
pancreatic
component
in
mumps
the
increase
is
attributable
to
the
salivary
component
in
pancreatic
insufficiency
serum
pancreatic
amylase
activities
were
significantly
lower
than
in
the
controls
our
method
is
simple
and
rapid
our
results
agree
well
with
those
of
other
authors
who
used
chromatographic
or
electrophoretic
methods
