demineralization
in
cystic

detected
by
direct
photon
absorptiometry
bone
mineral
content
bone
width
and
their
ratio
were
measured
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
using
monoenergetic
photon
absorptiometry
serial
measurements
of
the
radius
and
ulna
were
made
in
patients
with
cf
and
were
compared
with
age
matched
controls
demineralization
was
found
in
of
the
boys
and
of
the
girls
patients
under
age
years
had
normal
bone
mineral
content
and
nine
of
patients
aged
or
older
were
demineralized
p
less
than
demineralization
correlated
with
the
extent
of
weight
reduction
in
patients
p
less
than
patients
most
likely
to
be
demineralized
were
adolescent
girls
to
our
knowledge
this
is
the
first
report
of
bone
mineral
status
of
children
with
cf
and
the
results
indicate
that
a
sizable
proportion
of
these
patients
may
be
demineralized
without
overt
rickets
