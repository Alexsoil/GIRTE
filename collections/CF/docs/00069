clinical
variations
of
cystic
fibrosis
it
is
estimated
that
cystic
fibrosis
affects
approximately
one
of
every
white
children
born
in
the
united
states
and
is
now
generally
regarded
as
the
commonest
serious
metabolic
disorder
of
white
children
with
the
exception
of
diabetes
mellitus
its
occurrence
in
children
of
afro
americans
is
quite
rare
and
exceedingly
so
in
those
of
oriental
extraction
since
cystic
fibrosis
is
genetically
determined
as
an
autosomal
recessive
trait
and
since
the
obligate
heterozygote
parent
is
entirely
asymptomatic
the
disease
on
its
first
occurrence
in
a
given
family
can
only
be
suspected
by
its
manifestations
in
the
patient
himself
at
present
there
is
no
test
available
for
the
detection
of
cystic
fibrosis
which
can
be
applied
as
a
simple
practical
screening
test
such
as
is
available
for
phenylketonuria
diagnostic
tests
are
therefore
used
to
confirm
or
refute
the
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
when
suggestive
symptoms
arise
or
when
a
sibling
or
relative
is
known
to
have
the
disease
