a
screening
test
is
any
diagnostic
procedure
which
we
apply
without
a
specific
clinical
indication
from
the

screening
for
nonamino

acidurias
and

for

are
discussed
the
main
points
which
emerge
for
the
future
from
this
review
are
the
need
to
develop
multidisease
screening
programmes
to
detect
the
very
rare
diseases
that
postnatal
prenatal
and
carrier
screening
should
be
considered
and
developed
collectively
and
there

an

to
develop
