cystic
fibrosis
and
hypertrophic
osteoarthropathy
in
children
report
of
three
cases
three
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
were
noted
to
have
swelling
of
knee
and
ankle
joints
during
exacerbation
of
their
lung
disease
synovial
fluid
was
analyzed
in
one
patient
and
the
synovium
underwent
biopsy
in
another
these
studies
excluded
other
causes
of
arthritis
but
did
not
contribute
any
new
information
on
the
nature
of
secondary
hypertrophic
osteoarthropathy
radiological
examination
of
long
bones
confirmed
the
diagnosis
of
hypertrophic
osteoarthropathy
in
all
three
patients
since
many
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
survive
longer
more
instances
of
hypertrophic
osteoarthropathy
are
expected
in
the
future
