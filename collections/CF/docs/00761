pulmonary
diseases
in
children
respiratory
infections
in
infants
and
children
cause
much
ill
health
and
also
an
appreciable
mortality
they
are
found
at
times
in
most
school
children
and
in
infants
especially
those
in
large
families
and
those
living
in
poor
circumstances
in
all
respiratory
infections
the
whole
respiratory
tract
is
involved
for
descriptive
purposes
it
is
useful
to
divide
these
infections
into
upper
respiratory
tract
infections
in
which
the
infection
is
predominantly
at
the
larynx
or
above
and
lower
respiratory
tract
infections
in
which
the
predominant
infection
is
below
the
larynx
acute
upper
respiratory
tract
infections
are
usually
viral
and
the
poly
virus
infection
of
coryza
is
the
commonest
acute
lower
respiratory
tract
infections
are
discussed
in
two
groups
in
infants
under
two
years
of
age
and
in
children
over
two
including
cystic
fibrosis
