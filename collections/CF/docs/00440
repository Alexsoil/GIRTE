pp
cystic
fibrosis
is
a
recessively
inherited
metabolic
disease
which
is
characterized
by
a
universal
dysfunction
in
the
exocrine
glands
of
affected
individuals
this
dysfunction
results
in
abnormalities
of
the
composition
and
or
the
physiochemical
behavior
of
the
various
exocrine
gland
products
although
significant
advances
have
been
made
in
our
understanding
of
exocrine
gland
physiology
and
pharmacology
many
questions
remain
unanswered
and
significant
gaps
exist
in
our
knowledge
of
exocrine
gland
function
perhaps
clarification
of
these
issues
may
lead
to
better
understanding
of
the
pathogenesis
of
cystic
fibrosis
and
to
development
of
better
forms
of
therapy
for
the
patients
the
purpose
of
this
article
is
to
review
past
and
present
developments
in
this
area
of
biomedical
research
and
to
point
out
areas
of
exocrine
gland
physiology
and
pharmacology
where
more
knowledge
is
needed
in
order
to
clarify
the
nature
of
a
disease
like
cystic
fibrosis
composition
of
the
acinar
fluid
secretory
mechanisms
modification
of
ductal
fluid
ionic
dependence
and
energy
requirements
of
the
secretory
process
calcium
metabolism
in
exocrine
glands
and
exocrine
gland
dysfunction
in
cystic
fibrosis
are
discussed
