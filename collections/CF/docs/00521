absence
of
an
alpha
two
macroglobulin
protease
complex
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
present
study
using
immunologic
methodology
confirms
previous
observations
from
this
laboratory
of
an
absence
of
a
protease
component
with
arginine
esterase
activity
in
plasma
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
in
this
study
the
pooled
plasma
from
control
individuals
was
activated
and
partially
purified
after
adsorption
on
columns
of
soybean
trypsin
inhibitor
conjugated
to
sepharose
b
followed
by
elution
with
benzamidine
the
fraction
was
further
purified
by
isoelectrofocusing
on
polyacrylamide
gels
proteins
around
the
pi
range
of
were
eluted
and
utilized
to
prepare
an
antiserum
immunoelectrophoresis
of
activated
plasma
samples
from
control
subjects
and
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
was
performed
utilizing
the
antiserum
in
controls
four
precipitin
arcs
with
residual
esterase
activity
were
observed
whereas
only
three
were
seen
in
plasma
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
double
gel
diffusion
experiments
using
specific
antisera
ruled
out
the
presence
of
trypsin
chymotrypsin
plasminogen
prothrombin
c
esterase
alpha
one
trypsin
inhibitor
and
inter
alpha
trypsin
inhibitor
in
the
concentrated
benzamidine
eluate
the
antisera
to
alpha
two
macroglobulin
gave
an
immunoprecipitate
which
was
readily
stained
for
proteolytic
activity
on
immunoelectrophoresis
the
alpha
two
macroglobulin
precipitin
band
corresponded
to
the
band
absent
in
plasma
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
in
contrast
the
alpha
two
macroglobulin
levels
were
similar
in
plasma
of
control
subjects
and
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
using
the
antiserum
to
the
protein
fractith
proteolytic
activity
could
be
demonstrated
in
control
plasma
one
specific
enzyme
active
rocket
was
absent
in
plasma
of
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
in
a
double
blind
study
of
control
samples
and
samples
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
a
specific
rocket
was
shown
to
be
present
in
control
samples
and
absent
in
cystic
fibrosis
samples
alpha
two
macroglobulin
was
determined
by
both
an
immunologic
procedure
and
by
its
trypsin
binding
trypsin
protein
esterase
concentration
the
ratio
of
the
immunologic
assay
to
the
biologic
activity
assay
was
for
the
normal
plasma
samples
and
only
for
cystic
fibrosis
samples
