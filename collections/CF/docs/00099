cystic
fibrosis
manifested
as
focal
biliary
cirrhosis
in
a
newborn
infant
with
congenital
heart
disease
a
day
old
infant
meconium
stained
at
birth
presented
with
respiratory
distress
hypoplastic
left
heart
syndrome
was
diagnosed
clinically
and
documented
at
autopsy
unsuspected
cystic
fibrosis
was
demonstrated
by
the
histologic
presence
of
severe
focal
biliary
cirrhosis
with
spreading
fibrosis
in
the
liver
minimal
lesions
in
the
pancreas
and
intestines
were
compatible
with
a
diagnosis
of
cystic
fibrosis
the
abundant
hepatic
fibrosis
is
unusual
in
an
infant
of
this
age
indicating
its
in
utero
origin
this
case
is
also
unusual
because
of
the
fortuitous
association
of
cystic
fibrosis
and
a
congenital
cardiac
malformation
