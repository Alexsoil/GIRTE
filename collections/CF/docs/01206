in

letter
we
found
that
cystic
fibrosis
cf
patients
with
pancreatic
insufficiency
pi
had
a
statistically
lower
total
serum
amylase
level
than
normal
subjects
but
all
values
were
still
within
the
normal
range
although
we
found
that
the
absolute
amount
of
salivary
amylase
in
the
serum
of
patients
with
cf
and
pi
was
the
same
as
that
for
normal
subjects
the
percent
of
contribution
was
considerably
higher
we
found
that
the
pancreas
contributed
approximately
of
the
total
serum
amylase
in
cf
patients
with
pi
a
value
very
similar
to
the
amount
found
by
kamaryt
et
al
we
also
found
as
did
davidson
et
al
that
cf
patients
without
pi
had
higher
total
serum
amylase
values
than
did
normal
subjects
thus
we
feel
that
davidson
et
al
have
misinterpreted
the
results
of
our
previous
study
and
in
fact
we
feel
that
davidson
et
al
have
essentially
confirmed
our
previous
work
by
suggesting
that
cf
patients
with
pancreatic
insufficiency
have
an
increased
salivary
amylase
for
reasons
yet
unknown
our
experience
has
shown
that
indeed
the
pancreatic
portion
is
first
increased
and
then
decreases
as
the
patient
with
cf
and
apparent
normal
pancreatic
function
progresses
with
time
toward
pancreatic
insufficiency
however
the
changes
in
serum
amylase
values
in
patients
with
cf
are
on
the
average
due
to
changes
in
the
pancreatic
contribution
to
the
serum
and
as
expressed
as
a
mean
was
highly
significantly
different
for
both
normal
and
abnormal
pancreatic
function
the
second
important
point
of
our
paper
was
that
this
mean
variation
occurred
in
serum
samples
from
patients
with
cf
that
had
total
amylase
values
within
the
normal
test
range
the
serum
salivary
isoamylase
in
both
normals
and
patients
with
cf
and
pi
had
a
higher
serum
salivary
percent
