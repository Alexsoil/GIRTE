an
example
of
population
drift
possibly
with
heterozygote
advantage
an
incidence
of
the
genetic
recessive
disease
cystic
fibrosis
mucoviscidosis
far
in
excess
of
that
reported
recently
from
other
countries
has
been
encountered
in
the
south
west
african
afrikaner
this
has
probably
resulted
from
the
immigration
of
a
segment
of
the
south
african
afrikaner
population
rich
in
the
gene
into
south
west
africa
where
for
religious
reasons
and
reasons
of
geographical
isolation
the
gene
has
persisted
and
perhaps
increased
in
frequency
malaria
which
killed
many
of
the
early
settlers
might
have
selectively
spared
carriers
of
the
gene
thus
enriching
its
occurrence
in
the
population
details
of
patients
particularly
with
regard
to
the
criteria
of
diagnosis
are
given
with
the
relevant
population
and
birth
figures
from
which
an
estimate
of
the
incidence
of
the
disease
and
of
its
carrier
rate
has
been
made
screening
of
the

for
the
condition

the

are
also
discussed
