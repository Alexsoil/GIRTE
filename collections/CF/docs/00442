pp
although
complex
models
involving
multiple
loci
may
be
plausible
the
high
frequency
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
caucasians
is
probably
best
explained
by
selective
advantage
for
the
heterozygote
carrier
in
short
an
analogy
of
cystic
fibrosis
with
hemoglobin
s
sickle
cell
anemia
may
be
greater
than
with
tay
sachs
disease
in
terms
of
molecular
mechanisms
protein
and
polypeptide
differences
have
been
reported
for
the
humoral
fluids
of
cystic
fibrosis
patients
and
their
heterozygotic
relatives
in
connected
with
selected
bioassay
systems
these
directions
relate
to
a
model
here
proposed
for
the
intermediate
stages
of
the
physiology
of
cystic
fibrosis
which
builds
on
a
large
body
of
elegant
experimental
work
the
basic
tenet
is
that
the
cells
of
cystic
fibrosis
heterozygotes
and
normal
individuals
are
in
a
stimulatory
loop
chronic
reserpine
treatment
exaggerates
in
the
normal
rat
a
loop
similar
to
the
one
exaggerated
by
genetic
differences
in
the
human
elevating
to
pathological
levels
an
otherwise
normal
process
