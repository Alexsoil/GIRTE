serum
glutathione
reductase
and
cystic
fibrosis
we
have
obtained
additional
data
which
support
the
specificity
of
the
reported
serum
glutathione
reductase
gr
changes
in
cystic
fibrosis
cf
as
in
previous
series
mean
gr
in
cf
was
greater
than
in
controls
p
no
difference
was
found
between
cf
and
controls
for
either
lactate
dehydrogenase
ldh
or
glutamic
pyruvic
transaminase
gpt
it
appears
that
some
underlying
process
or
processes
such
as
leakage
into
serum
from
cellular
damage
as
reflected
in
raised
ldh
and
gpt
might
lead
to
raised
gr
as
demonstrated
by
positive
correlations
in
controls
the
absence
of
a
positive
correlation
between
these
enzymes
and
gr
in
the
cf
sample
as
well
as
normal
values
for
ldh
and
gpt
in
cf
suggests
that
the
raised
serum
gr
in
cf
is
not
attributable
to
tissue
leakage
from
damaged
cells
secondary
to
the
disease
