a
quantitative
survey
by
analysis
of
the
shadowgraph
finger
clubbing
has
been
measured
from
the
magnified
silhouette
of
the
right
index
finger
shadowgram
in
subjects
comprising
children
and
young
adults
the
profile
and
hyponychial
angles
were
both
found
to
be
good
discriminators
of
clubbing
and
to
be
independent
of
age
and
sex
the
normal
profile
angle
was
degrees
and
the
mean
normal
hyponychial
angle
was
degrees
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
cyanotic
congenital
heart
disease
were
found
to
have
grossly
elevated
values
of
these
angles
some
asthmatics
were
found
to
have
a
moderate
degree
of
clubbing
with
significantly
elevated
values
of
these
angles
the
shadowgram
proved
a
convenient
objective
method
for
recording
the
degree
and
progress
of
fingerclubbing
in
clinical
practice
