multifocal
myocardial
necrosis
and
fibrosis
in
pancreatic
diseases
of
children
from
a
review
of
autopsies
of
children
cases
of
extensive
necrosis
and
scarring
fibrosis
of
the
myocardium
were
found
these
lesions
involved
mainly
the
left
ventricle
and
spared
the
endocardium
the
pericardium
and
the
coronary
vessels
these
necrotic
of
fibrotic
heart
lesions
were
found
to
be
closely
associated
with
various
pancreatic
diseases
cystic
fibrosis
cases
pancreatic
lipomatosis
cases
extensive
small
bowel
resection
cases
of
which
were
associated
with
acute
interstitial
pancreatitis
to
explain
these
unexpected
associations
two
hypotheses
can
be
put
forth
the
lack
of
absorption
of
some
presently
undetermined
substances
indispensable
for
the
correct
trophicity
of
the
myocardium
and
the
release
in
the
blood
of
proteolytic
enzymes
with
consecutive
activation
of
phlogistic
substances
such
as
kinins
