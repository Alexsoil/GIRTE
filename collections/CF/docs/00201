ciliary
inhibition
and
axonemal
microtubule
alterations
in
freshwater
mussels
a
phenomenon
associated
with
the
genetic
disease
of
cystic
fibrosis
cf
is
the
presence
of
a
serum
factor
that
stops
or
discoordinates
ciliary
beating
this
effect
has
been
demonstrated
by
exposing
freshwater
mussel
or
oyster
gill
cilia
or
rabbit
tracheal
cilia
to
sera
from
homozygous
or
heterozygous
cystic
fibrosis
subjects
assay
reproducibility
is
unsatisfactory
however
and
the
mechanism
of
the
effect
is
not
understood
nor
do
we
know
why
there
may
be
considerable
differences
between
the
activity
of
tested
heterozygotes
and
of
homozygotes
because
the
ciliary
assay
is
capricious
there
is
a
need
to
understand
how
ciliary
beating
is
disturbed
or
stopped
since
microtubules
are
important
in
the
mechanism
of
ciliary
motion
they
could
conceivably
show
alterations
during
the
response
to
inhibitory
substances
there
has
been
no
ultrastructural
study
however
of
the
effects
of
ciliary
inhibition
on
the
axonemal
components
therefore
this
study
was
designed
to
examine
ciliary
structure
during
the
different
stages
of
ciliary
inhibition
rapid
microtubular
disappearance
and
reappearance
occurs
in
the
terminal
cilia
of
the
freshwater
mussel
unio
when
exposure
to
cf
serum
causes
a
shock
stop
reaction
and
return
to
water
allows
resumption
of
normal
ciliary
beating
in
contrast
a
slow
stop
reaction
causes
distortion
of
cilia
asynchronous
beating
and
ejection
of
cells
from
the
distal
gill
filament
but
ciliary
axonemal
structure
is
preserved
slow
stopped
cilia
do
not
resume
their
beating
in
water
saliva
from
reserpine
treated
rats
causes
ciliary
inhibition
similar
to
that
induced
by
cf
serum
