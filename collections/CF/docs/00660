influence

bile
acid
kinetics
was
investigated
by
stable
isotope
dilution
technique
in
children
ages
months
to
years
with
previously
untreated
cystic
fibrosis
all
of
the
patients
had
clinical
and
laboratory
evidence
of
malabsorption
normal
intestinal
mucosal
function
as
judged
by
glucose
absorption
intestinal
histology
disaccharidase
levels
and
normally
functioning
gallbladders
the
children
were
maintained
on
a
constant
diet
throughout
the
study
period
fat
intake
averaged
g
per
kg
per
day
before
administration
of
pancreatic
enzyme
replacement
fat
excretion
equalled
plus
or
minus
mean
plus
or
minus
se
of
intake
and
was
reduced
to
plus
or
minus
of
intake
after
therapy
total
bile
acid
pool
size
nearly
doubled
during
enzyme
replacement
from
plus
or
minus
micromoles
per
kg
to
plus
or
minus
micromoles
per
kg
with
secondary
bile
acids
comprising
of
the
total
pool
before
therapy
and
after
therapy
total
bile
acid
synthesis
changed
little
with
therapy
equalling
plus
or
minus
micromoles
per
kg
per
day
total
plus
or
minus
mg
per
day
without
enzyme
replacement
and
plus
or
minus
micromoles
per
kg
per
day
total
plus
or
minus
milligrams
per
day
with
enzyme
replacement
this
was
confirmed
by
the
fecal
excretion
of
bile
acids
plus
or
minus
milligrams
of
bile
acid
per
day
were
excreted
without
enzymes
as
compared
to
plus
or
minus
milligrams
per
day
with
enzymes
after
therapy
the
fractional
turnover
rate
of
the
bile
acid
pool
was
reduced
from
plus
or
minus
per
day
to
plus
or
minus
per
day
for
cholic
acidand
from
plus
or
minus
per
day
to
plus
or
minus
per
day
for
chenodeoxycholic
acid
these
data
indicate
that
both
primary
and
secondary
bile
acids
are
conserved
within
the
enterohepatic
circulation
during
enzyme
therapy
and
that
the
mechanism
for
the
regulation
of
hepatic
bile
acid
synthesis
is
intact
in
cystic
fibrosis
however
the
demonstration
that
large
amounts
of
bile
acid
continue
to
be
excreted
during
therapy
suggests
that
interruption
of
the
enterohepatic
circulation
continues
and
that
deficiencies
of
the
intraluminal
phase
may
persist
during
enzyme
therapy
in
this
disease
