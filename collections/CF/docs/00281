letter
frequency
of
cystic
fibrosis
gene
mr
stuart
and
dr
burdon
speculate
on
the
possibility
that
the
high
frequency
of
the
cystic
fibrosis
gene
among
caucasians
may
be
due
to
the
heterozygotes
having
some
advantage
in
biological
fitness
over
normal
homozygotes
they
suggest
that
this
might
be
due
to
increased
resistance
to
typhus
once
endemic
in
europe
on
the
basis
of
the
well
known
immunological
cross
reactivity
between
the
causative
organism
rickettsia
prowazeki
and
certain
strains
of
the
species
proteus
vulgaris
which
is
agglutinated
by
sera
from
cystic
fibrosis
patients
and
heterozygotes
however
there
is
no
evidence
that
this
agglutination
is
an
immunological
reaction
it
appears
microscopically
to
be
associated
with
disorganisation
and
inhibition
of
the
bacterial
flagellae
leading
to
clumping
of
the
organisms
as
such
it
is
probably
analogous
to
the
effect
on
cilia
of
rabbit
trachea
and
oyster
or
mussel
gills
the
cilia
factor
although
associated
with
igg
is
now
known
not
to
be
igg
itself
and
may
well
be
the
c
a
component
of
complement
these
and
other
observations
such
as
those
on
salivary
and
sweat
gland
secretions
and
on
sodium
flux
suggest
that
all
these
phenomena
are
membrane
rather
than
immunological
effects
although
it
is
possible
that
a
proteus
flagella
antigen
could
also
be
the
binding
site
for
the
cilia
factor
this
seems
improbable
an
alternative
hypothesis
is
that
heterozygotes
for
the
cystic
fibrosis
gene
have
increased
resistance
to
tuberculosis
this
would
meet
the
requirement
of
a
common
disease
recently
endemic
in
europe
at
least
as
well
as
typhus
and
is
suggested
by
indirect
evidence
from
a
family
study
demonstrating
a
significantly
lower
incidence
of
tuberculosis
among
the
parents
of
cystic
fibrosis
patients
than
among
parents
of
controls
