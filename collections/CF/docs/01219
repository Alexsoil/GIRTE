metabolic
alkalosis
in
infants
with
cystic
fibrosis
letter
i
have
diagnosed
six
cystic
fibrosis
infants
under
year
of
age
four
of
whom
had
documented
episodes
of
hypoelectrolytemia
and
severe
metabolic
alkalosis
these
additional
data
support
our
previous
hypothesis
that
chronic
sweat
electrolyte
depletion
more
frequently
than
previously
recognized
can
cause
severe
metabolic
derangements
in
infants
with
cystic
fibrosis
especially
those
living
in
both
humid
and
dry
hot
climates
