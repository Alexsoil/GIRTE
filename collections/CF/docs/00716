letter
we
found
that
the
szczepanski
bromide
test
which
we
simplified
with
the
aid
of
ion
sensitive
electrode
is
suitable
for
the
detection
of
c
f
heterozygosity
in
most
cases
we
examined
the
sweat
of
randomly
selected
children
with
respiratory
asthma
during
the
past
years
the
sodium
and
chloride
concentrations
and
bromide
index
being
determined
sodium
and
chloride
concentrations
in
the
sweat
of
the
asthma
children
were
slightly
but
significantly
higher
p
than
those
of
the
controls
the
difference
in
bromide
index
was
even
more
significant
p
this
suggests
that
c
f
gene
carriers
are
unusually
prevalent
among
children
with
bronchial
asthma
one
possibility
is
that
enhanced
ion
loss
in
various
diseases
with
allergic
pathological
mechanisms
is
secondary
in
nature
however
this
seems
unlikely
since
in
our
material
high
sweat
electrolyte
concentrations
were
observed
in
only
a
proportion
of
control
children
whose
illness
was
similar
in
severity
to
that
of
the
asthmatic
children
and
normal
sweat
values
were
obtained
even
when
the
child
s
condition
was
very
serious
