screening
of

in
newborn
infants
with
the

chloride
measuring
system
and
incorporating

innovations
is
described
the
results
indicate
that
while
diagnostic

for
cystic

can
be
readily
undertaken
the
test
with
the
chloride
ion
selective
electrode
is
best
left
at
least
to
the
second
day
of
life
or
later
because
of
insufficient
sweating
in
very
young
babies
measurements
on
babies
with
cystic

are
also
discussed
