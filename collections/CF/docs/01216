hypoelectrolytemia
and
metabolic
alkalosis
in
infants
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
records
of
all
children
in
the
tucson
area
diagnosed
as
having
cystic
fibrosis
cf
before
the
age
of
months
were
reviewed
to
ascertain
the
prevalence
of
metabolic
alkalosis
as
a
major
presenting
manifestation
of
cf
five
of
eleven
infants
in
whom
cf
had
been
diagnosed
between
and
months
of
age
initially
were
seen
with
hypokalemia
hypochloremia
and
metabolic
alkalosis
unassociated
with
marked
dehydration
hyperpyrexia
or
major
pulmonary
and
or
gastrointestinal
symptoms
two
infants
had
repeated
episodes
of
metabolic
alkalosis
for
one
of
these
infants
both
episodes
of
metabolic
alkalosis
occurred
before
the
diagnosis
of
cf
it
is
postulated
that
chronic
loss
of
sweat
electrolytes
together
with
mild
gastrointestinal
or
respiratory
illness
may
predispose
the
infant
with
cystic
fibrosis
to
a
severe
electrolyte
and
acid
base
disturbance
the
lack
of
shock
and
hyperpyrexia
together
with
the
apparent
chronicity
of
electrolyte
losses
differentiates
metabolic
alkalosis
from
the
heat
prostration
syndrome
a
more
acute
complication
of
cystic
fibrosis
quantitative
sweat
testing
should
be
part
of
the
evaluation
of
any
infant
with
unexplained
metabolic
alkalosis
serum
electrolytes
should
be
assessed
regularly
in
infants
with
cystic
fibrosis
during
hot
weather
months
