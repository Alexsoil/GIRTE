on

jejunum
the
short

current
rat
jejunum
bioassay
first
employed
in
an
attempt
to
discern
the
cystic
fibrosis
cf
serum
factor
was
evaluated
using
sera
from
patients
with
pancreatic
disease
the
data
suggest
other
pancreatic
diseases
specifically
genetic
diabetes
and
alcoholic
pancreatitis
also
present
with
a
serum
factor
or
factors
which
reduce
the
short
circuit
current
of
rat
jejunum
an
effect
very
similar
to
that
of
the
cf
serum
factor
a
large
number
of
sera
from
presumed
normal
subjects
also
exhibited
a
significant
reduction
in
short
circuit
current
these
false
positives
represent
a
yet
to
be
defined
mechanism
however
they
do
decrease
the
likelihood
that
the
observed
effect
is
merely
due
to
pancreatic
destruction
