use
of
a
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
vaccine
in
pateints
with
acute
leukemia
and
cystic
fibrosis
a
heptavalent
lipopolysaccharide
pseudomonas
vaccine
was
evaluated
in
patients
with
acute
leukemia
and
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
during
an
month
interval
at
the
clinical
center
of
the
national
institutes
of
health
of
the
patients
had
an
excellent
serum
hemagglutinating
ha
antibody
response
to
immunization
in
comparison
to
the
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
the
patients
with
leukemia
had
a
smaller
ha
antibody
response
which
lasted
a
shorter
period
of
time
and
also
i
experienced
greater
toxicity
from
the
vaccine
the
mixing
of
adrenal
corticosteroids
with
vaccine
greatly
decreased
side
reactions
among
the
patients
with
leukemia
without
significantly
inhibiting
antibody
production
previous
antineoplastic
chemotherapy
had
little
influence
on
antibody
response
in
patients
with
leukemia
with
the
exception
of
methortrexate
vaccinated
patients
with
leukemia
had
pseudomonas
infection
of
bacterial
or
fungal
infections
whereas
pseudomonas
infections
of
bacterial
or
fungal
infections
occurred
in
a
control
group
of
patients
with
acute
leukemia
of
the
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
had
a
pseudomonas
infection
after
vaccination
