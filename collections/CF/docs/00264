one
researcher
s
opinion
recently
there
has
been
a
plethora
of
research
approaches
using
cell
culture
to
study
cystic
fibrosis
although
these
efforts
can
be
lauded
as
attempts
to
understand
one
of
the
most
common
genetic
disorders
affecting
the
caucasian
population
such
research
should
be
relevant
to
the
clinical
entity
known
as
cystic
fibrosis
the
ultimate
objectives
of
this
research
should
be
to
determine
the
as
yet
unknown
basic
defect
and
to
develop
an
assay
for
heterozygote
detection
