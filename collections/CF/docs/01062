serum
from
patients
with
cystic

and
control
subjects
without

was
analyzed
for
carboxypeptidase

hippuryl
l
lysine
and
serum
fourteen
of
the
cystic

patients
had
no
steatorrhea
and
therefore
minimal
pancreatic
dysfunction
patients
with

controls
were
of

age
serum
carboxypeptidase
b

was
significantly
decreased

patients

significantly
low

found
in
both

although

serum
carboxypeptidase

therefore
falls
with

may
limit
