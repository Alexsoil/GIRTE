the

in

populations
estimates
of
the
newborn
frequency
of
cystic
fibrosis
in
different
caucasian
groups
range
from
times
more
to
times
less
common
than
the
generally
accepted
figure
of
current
meconium
screening
trials
which
may
be
effective
in
populations
with
the
incidence
equal
to
or
greater
than
may
be
useful
for
populations
with
an
incidence
as
low
as
only
after

improvement
of
the
methods
once
the
true
incidence

the

incidence
is
proven
for
caucasian

screening

will
be
