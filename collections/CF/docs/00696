treatment
of
pulmonary
infections
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
a
comparative
study
of
ticarcillin
and
gentamicin
the
effectiveness
of
ticarcillin
against
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
in
acute
exacerbations
of
pulmonary
infection
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
was
evaluated
seventy
one
percent
of
patients
treated
with
ticarcillin
alone
responded
favorably
the
response
rate
was
similar
in
patients
treated
with
a
combination
of
ticarcillin
plus
gentamicin
or
with
gentamicin
alone
severity
of
the
underlying
disease
was
the
most
important
determinant
of
response
to
treatment
ticarcillin
resistant
organisms
were
recovered
during
treatment
in
of
patients
who
received
this
drug
recovery
of
them
was
not
prevented
by
the
inclusion
of
gentamicin
in
the
therapeutic
regimen
nor
did
they
interfere
with
clinical
improvement
the
ticarcillin
resistant
strains
persisted
at
follow
up
two
to
six
months
after
completion
of
therapy
in
only
one
of
ten
patients
no
serious
toxicity
to
ticarcillin
was
noted
during
the
study
period
