response
to
bronchial
provocation
and
exercise
in
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
ten
of
fifteen
cystic
fibrosis
children
with
positive
skin
prick
tests
to
common
antigens
gave
an
immediate
bronchial
reaction
to
the
antigen
inhaled
five
of
them
also
gave
a
late
reaction
however
only
one
gave
a
history
of
asthma
the
antigen
most
commonly
eliciting
a
positive
skin
reaction
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
is
aspergillus
fumigatus
in
six
children
tested
to
this
antigen
the
bronchial
response
varied
two
were
negative
one
gave
an
immediate
reaction
and
three
gave
a
dual
immediate
and
late
reaction
none
of
the
children
showed
the
characteristic
pattern
of
response
to
exercise
seen
in
asthmatic
patients
an
initial
rise
in
peak
expiratory
flow
rate
followed
by
a
fall
of
greater
than
below
the
resting
level
two
patients
showed
an
abnormal
rise
in
peak
expiratory
flow
rate
during
exercise
a
pattern
described
previously
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
results
suggest
that
bronchial
allergy
immediate
or
late
does
completely
explain
susceptibility
to
asthma
and
that
other
factors
including
perhaps
the
type
of
bronchial
reactivity
shown
by
bronchoconstriction
after
exercise
may
be
required
however
the
majority
of
the
children
tested
had
bronchial
allergy
and
anti
allergy
therapy
such
as
inhaled
sodium
cromoglycate
may
have
a
place
in
the
management
of
selected
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
