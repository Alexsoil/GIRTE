the
determination
of
vitamin
a
and
some
aspects
of
its
distribution
mobilization
and
transport
in
health
and
disease
the
author
has
attempted
to
evaluate
some
of
the
methodology
currently
in
use
or
suggested
for
the
routine
determination
of
vitamin
a
in
blood
and
tissues
special
consideration
is
given
to
extraneous
factors
which
can
cause
erroneous
results
in
fluorometric
analyses
a
review
of
the
older
and
current
literature
on
the
distribution
of
vitamin
a
in
tissues
is
presented
special
consideration
is
given
to
the
uptake
of
vitamin
a
by
the
liver
and
its
storage
in
hepatocytes
and
kupffer
s
cell
and
in
subcellular
organelles
data
on
the
concentration
of
vitamin
a
in
the
liver
of
victims
of
accidental
death
and
the
effect
of
diseases
of
several
etiologies
are
presented
the
mechanism
by
which
liver
stores
of
retinyl
esters
are
mobilized
and
released
to
the
plasma
remains
obscure
considerable
information
has
been
gained
recently
on
the
mechanism
by
which
retinol
is
transported
in
blood
studies
leading
to
the
isolation
and
characterization
of
retinol
transport
proteins
are
summarized
the
metabolism
of
retinol
binding
protein
in
health
and
in
disease
especially
in
cystic
fibrosis
is
discussed
finally
some
factors
of
importance
to
the
interpretation
of
plasma
levels
in
terms
of
vitamin
a
are
reviewed
special
attention
is
given
to
the
effect
on
plasma
levels
of
retinol
and
the
retinol
transport
proteins
of
periods
of
rapid
growth
correlations
with
age
and
the
influence
of
dietary
adequacy
on
the
distribution
of
plasma
levels
of
the
vitamin
