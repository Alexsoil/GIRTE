characteristics
of

electrode
filling
solution
leakage
reproducibility
stability
interferences
and

have
been
studied
in
relation
to
the
use
of
the
orion
combination
chloride
ion
selective
electrode
in
sweat
testing
for
cystic
fibrosis
while
stability
and
reproducibility
is
good
certain
antiseptic
systems
and
especially
hibitaine
chlorhexidine
gluconate
interfere
with
the
electrode
and
therefore
need
to
be
absent
during
sweat
testing
temperature
conditions
during
calibration
and
sweat
testing
need
to
be
controlled
in
view
of
the
extent
of
response
variations
for
even
modest
temperature

between
sensor
