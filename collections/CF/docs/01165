the
aim
of
the
present
study
is
to
reassess
the
peripheral
pattern
of
thyroid
function
in
subjects
with
cystic
fibrosis
with
special
reference
to
their
responsiveness
to
thyrotropin
releasing
hormone
trh
stimulation
in
all
the
cf
patients
the
basal
levels
of
serum
t
t
and
tbg
were
within
the
normal
range
mean
values
in
cf
patients
and
in
control
children
were
not
significantly
different
in
cf
patients
there
is
no
correlation
between
the
tsh
response
area
and
the
basal
level
of
serum
t
or
with
grading
according
to
shwachman
and
kulczycki
we
found
no
relation
with
therapy
in
basal
conditions
our
data
show
a
completely
normal
pattern
of
the
serum
concentration
of
t
t
tbg
and
tsh
in
subjects
with
cf
in
absence
of
iodide
therapy
thyroid
status
should
be
examined
in
patients
with
cf
specially
when
they
receive
iodide
therapy
or
other
drugs
which
can
enhance
the
impairment
of
thyroid
function
