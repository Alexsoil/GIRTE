vi
synergistic
effects
of
isoproterenol
on
ca
and
protein
in
the
submaxillary
gland
elevated
calcium
and
protein
concentration
are
a
consistent
abnormality
in
submaxillary
saliva
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
and
from
experimental
animal
models
developed
by
the
chronic
administration
of
either
isoproterenol
ipr
or
reserpine
the
possibility
that
the
effects
of
the
two
drugs
may
be
additive
was
investigated
by
assessing
their
combined
effects
on
glandular
and
salivary
c
and
protein
in
the
rat
submaxillary
gland
individually
their
effects
were
also
assessed
in
relation
to
the
dose
used
results
indicate
that
treatment
for
days
with
and
mg
kg
daily
dose
of
reserpine
caused
respectively
a
and
increase
in
glandular
ca
and
a
and
increase
in
glandular
protein
treatment
for
days
with
a
mg
kg
daily
dose
of
isoproterenol
caused
a
increase
in
gland
ca
and
a
increase
in
gland
protein
treatment
with
a
mg
rat
daily
dose
of
this
drug
caused
increases
of
and
in
gland
ca
and
protein
in
experiments
involving
a
combination
of
the
two
drugs
isoproterenol
was
administered
in
a
mg
kg
daily
dose
from
days
and
reserpine
in
a
mg
kg
daily
dose
from
days
of
the
treatment
schedule
this
procedure
resulted
in
a
a
increase
in
gland
ca
and
a
increase
in
gland
protein
b
a
marked
accumulation
of
a
granular
basophilic
material
in
acinar
cells
and
the
development
of
intraductal
precipitates
c
the
secretion
of
turbid
saliva
with
high
ca
and
protein
concentrations
after
a
secretory
dose
of
isoproterenol
this
type
of
stimulation
also
reduced
the
gland
ca
and
protein
contents
and
produced
vacuolization
in
the
acinar
cells
d
the
secretion
of
saliva
with
elevated
ca
and
protein
in
response
to
pilocarpine
these
elevated
concentrations
were
however
one
fifth
of
those
obtained
after
isoproterenol
stimulation
e
the
secretion
of
smaller
volume
of
saliva
after
both
types
of
stimulation
these
findings
indicate
that
both
ipr
and
reserpine
have
a
dose
related
and
significant
effect
on
submaxillary
gland
ca
and
protein
and
that
their
individual
effects
are
synergistic
the
implications
of
this
synergism
for
the
physiologic
state
of
the
submaxillary
gland
and
for
the
secretory
abnormality
of
cystic
fibrosis
are
discussed
