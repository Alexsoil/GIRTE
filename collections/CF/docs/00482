screening
for
cystic
fibrosis
c
f
in
the
newborn
has
been
in
vogue
since
the
introduction
of
a
rapid
simple
test
based
in
the
presence
of
albumin
in
the
meconium
of
c
f
babies
false
positive
tests
have
been
observed
in
prematurity
or
when
the
specimen
is
contaminated
with
blood
we
have
reduced
the
number
of
false
positives
by
additional
studies
on
the
meconium
including
detection
of
lactase
lactase
activity
can
be
detected
in
meconium
from
babies
with
c
f
but
not
in
meconium
for
healthy
babies
in
testing
normal
meconiums
with
a
negative
albumin
test
we
noted
positive
tests
for
lactase
these
patients
did
not
have
c
f
these
false
positive
lactase
tests
could
be
distinguished
by
the
addition
of
distilled
water
to
the
meconium
instead
of
lactose
this
simple
test
may
provide
an
additional
or
alternative
method
for
detection
of
c
f
in
a
screening
programme
when
this
test
is
used
in
addition
to
the
albumin
test
the
number
of
false
positive
albumin
tests
will
be
reduced
