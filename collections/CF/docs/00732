nasal
polypectomy
and
sinus
surgery
for
cystic
fibrosis
a
year
review
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
are
likely
to
develop
nasal
polyps
and
pansinusitis
this
presentation
concerns
the
results
of
various
surgical
procedures
used
to
treat
nasal
polyposis
in
cystic
fibrosis
at
present
recurrent
nasal
polyposis
is
still
the
major
problem
following
surgery
the
literature
does
not
deal
specifically
with
comparisons
of
different
surgical
procedures
aimed
at
controlling
nasal
obstruction
or
with
the
surgical
management
of
sinus
disease
in
cystic
fibrosis
patients
perhaps
this
lack
reflects
the
unsatisfactory
results
that
would
have
to
be
reported
since
a
high
recurrence
rate
is
expected
also
the
prolonged
survival
in
these
children
means
that
more
of
them
are
reaching
adolescence
and
adulthood
with
an
increasing
risk
for
nasal
obstruction
and
nasal
polyposis
