pancreatic
alpha
and
beta
cell
functions
in
cystic
fibrosis
insulin
and
glucagon
secretions
were
studied
during
oral
glucose
tolerance
testing
and
arginine
infusion
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
two
groups
of
patients
were
identified
group
i
n
whose
ogtt
was
entirely
normal
and
group
ii
n
who
had
some
abnormality
in
glucose
during
ogtt
in
each
group
basal
glucagon
concentrations
were
normal
and
supressed
appropriately
p
less
than
after
glucose
insulin
responses
were
attenuated
and
the
peak
responses
delayed
during
arginine
stimulation
insulin
secretion
was
impaired
in
each
group
however
glucagon
secretion
was
diminished
only
in
group
ii
thus
insulinopenia
was
found
in
both
groups
and
hyperglucagonemia
was
not
found
as
a
contributory
factor
to
the
hyperglycemia
in
group
ii
