detection
of
cystic
fibrosis
homozygotes
and
heterozygotes
with
plasma
evidence
is
accumulating
which
indicates
that
the
basic
defect
in
cystic
fibrosis
interferes
with
the
formation
of
recognition
markers
on
hydrolytic
enzymes
as
a
result
these
hydrolases
leak
into
the
extracellular
space
and
some
of
them
display
abnormal
thermolabilities
by
heat
inactivation
of
plasma
alpha
mannosidase
at
degrees
c
and
plasma
phosphatase
at
degrees
c
both
enzymes
being
assayed
at
ph
it
is
possible
to
differentiate
normal
people
from
cystic
fibrosis
carriers
and
patients
