detection
of
cystic
fibrosis
protein
by
isoelectric
focusing
of
serum
letter
several
cystic
fibrosis
research
groups
have
independently
attempted
to
reproduce
the
isoelectric
focusing
work
of
wilson
et
al
the
protocol
that
we
employed
with
the
lkb
mulitphor
electrofocusing
apparatus
was
that
of
wilson
et
al
although
fixing
and
staining
of
the
polyacrylamide
gels
was
performed
in
a
boiling
water
bath
for
min
in
of
sera
from
patients
with
cf
the
cystic
fibrosis
protein
band
was
directly
identified
by
each
of
two
independent
observers
and
in
the
sera
from
nine
obligate
heterozygote
individuals
the
cfp
band
was
noted
in
seven
and
eight
instances
by
each
observer
respectively
in
sera
from
normal
control
individuals
the
cfp
band
was
observed
in
two
instances
our
results
would
support
the
view
that
the
cfp
band
is
indeed
directly
identifiable
in
both
ct
heterozygote
and
homozygote
sera
without
recourse
to
photographic
image
enhancement
and
that
its
frequency
of
occurrence
is
similar
to
that
reported
previously
