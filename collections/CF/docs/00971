cultured
skin
fibroblasts
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
are
more
resistant
to
dexamethasone
toxicity
than
are
normal
cells
we
now
report
that
when
fibroblasts
cultured
from
obligate
cf
heterozygotes
are
exposed
to
dexamethasone
they
have
an
intermediate
survival
compared
to
normal
and
homozygous
cf
cells
when
dexamethasone
survival
was
tested
on
cells
from
four
patients
undergoing
amniocentesis
cells
from
a
woman
at
risk
of
producing
a
child
with
cf
showed
significant
dexamethasone
resistance
similar
to
that
of
fibroblasts
derived
from
lnown
cf
homozygotes
the
other
amniotic
cell
specimens
showed
dexamethasone
sensitivity
similar
to
that
of
normal
skin
fibroblasts
these
data
suggest
that
the
dexamethasone
resistance
previously
observed
in
skin
fibroblasts
may
also
be
useful
in
the
prenatal
diagnosis
of
cf
