therapeutic
possibilities
in
pseudomonas
infections
acute
pseudomonas
infections
require
treatment
with
antibiotics
producing
a
bactericidal
effect
the
most
useful
are
gentamicin
tobramycin
sisomicin
and
polymyxin
b
in
resistant
strains
amikacin
is
indicated
in
addition
carbenicillin
ticarcillin
carfenicillin
or
azocillin
should
never
be
given
alone
but
in
combination
with
some
of
the
above
preparations
other
drugs
such
as
chloramphenicol
tetracycline
or
streptomycin
though
effective
in
vitro
should
be
avoided
chemotherapy
may
be
complemented
by
passive
immunization
either
with
hyperimmune
specific
gama
globulin
or
hyperimmune
plasma
a
programmatic
item
of
combined
treatment
is
active
immunization
especially
with
toxoid
vaccine
chronic
processes
are
not
perhaps
with
the
exception
of
urinary
infections
suitable
for
antibiotic
therapy
for
this
reason
effective
polyvalent
vaccines
should
be
developed
from
appropriate
strains
it
is
now
certain
that
in
infections
caused
by
mucous
strains
most
frequently
encountered
in
cystic
fibrosis
the
vaccine
should
be
prepared
from
these
strains
since
they
have
distinct
functional
and
antigenic
characteristics
