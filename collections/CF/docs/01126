sensitive
trypsin
assay
for
dried
blood
specimens
as
a
screening
procedure
for
early
detection
of
cystic
fibrosis
an
immunoreactive
trypsin
assay
uses
small
dried
blood
spots
diameter
mm
and
is
therefore
suitable
for
incorporation
in
established
neonatal
screening
schemes
blood
specimens
from
neonates
with
cystic
fibrosis
had
trypsin
levels
greater
than
those
in
control
subjects
thus
confirming
earlier
findings
trypsin
levels
were
below
normal
in
several
older
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
