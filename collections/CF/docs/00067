the
expression
of
inherited
metabolic
disease
in
cultured
cells
since
improvements
in
general
hygiene
and
the
development
of
antibiotic
therapy
have
enabled
many
of
the
epidemic
infectious
diseases
particularly
those
of
infancy
and
early
childhood
increasingly
to
be
controlled
in
contrast
the
morbidity
and
mortality
of
diseases
of
genetic
origin
have
been
little
affected
the
rational
use
of
cell
culture
as
an
investigative
technique
in
inherited
metabolic
disease
is
rooted
in
the
simple
biologic
truth
that
since
a
full
complement
of
chromosomes
is
present
in
all
somatic
cells
it
should
be
possible
to
detect
the
specific
biochemical
consequences
of
gene
activity
in
cultured
fibroblasts
unless
during
the
process
of
differentiation
genes
are
irreversibly
inactivated
the
usefulness
of
tissue
culture
in
investigating
inherited
metabolic
disease
does
not
rest
with
the
biochemical
identification
of
the
primary
defect
the
cells
in
culture
provide
a
model
system
of
the
disease
which
can
be
used
to
test
the
possible
effectiveness
of
therapeutic
agents
tissue
culture
techniques
indicated
that
the
cells
derived
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
showed
metachromasia
although
the
isolation
and
characterization
of
cystic
fibrosis
from
cystic
fibrosis
serum
has
not
been
accomplished
a
number
of
properties
have
been
described
