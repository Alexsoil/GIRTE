in
children
and

cystic
fibrosis
an
autosomal
recessive
disorder
remains
the
most
common
lethal
genetic
disease
of
caucasian
people
the
diagnosis
of
cf
is
usually
made
based
upon
the
clinical
presentation
of
chronic
respiratory
and
or
gastrointestinal
symptoms
a
positive
sweat
electrolyte
test
and
often
a
family
history
of
the
disorder
the
manifestations
of
chronic
cough
recurrent
pneumonias
bronchiectasis
with
clubbing
pneumothorax
hemoptysis
and
malabsorption
secondary
to
pancreatic
insufficiency
are
so
well
associated
with
cystic
fibrosis
that
the
diagnosis
is
usually
not
delayed
however
it
is
often
not
appreciated
by
physicians
that
cf
may
be
associated
with
a
broad
spectrum
of
less
common
manifestations
as
well
as
extreme
variability
in
severity
of
illness
lack
of
familiarity
with
these
manifestations
may
delay
diagnosis
until
adolescence
or
adulthood
first
there
seems
to
