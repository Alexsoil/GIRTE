measurement
of
regional
lung
function
by
tetrapolar
electrical
impedance
plethysmography
this
study
demonstrates
the
clinical
feasibility
of
atraumatically
measuring
dynamic
regional
lung
function
with
tetrapolar
electrical
impedance
plethysmography
eip
in
the
pediatric
age
group
a
tetrapolar
electrode
system
was
used
because
of
its
ability
to
detect
local
baseline
and
pulsatile
impedance
changes
minimal
electrode
tissue
impedance
interference
and
uniform
current
distribution
studies
performed
on
children
to
years
old
with
various
pulmonary
diseases
are
presented
the
information
obtained
on
their
regional
ventilation
and
pulsatile
perfusion
by
eip
was
found
to
agree
closely
with
pulmonary
ventilation
and
perfusion
scans
in
one
case
eip
detected
pulsatile
perfusion
abnormalities
which
were
not
apparent
in
the
non
pulsatile
perfusion
scan
but
were
demonstrated
by
cineangiography
it
is
concluded
that
tetrapolar
eip
can
provide
safe
reliable
regional
information
about
ventilation
and
perfusion
in
diseased
lungs
and
because
of
its
atraumatic
approach
is
technically
most
suitable
for
use
in
children
