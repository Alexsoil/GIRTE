letter
we
measured
immunoreactive
trypsin
irt
concentrations
in
patients
with
established
cystic
fibrosis
and
in
parents
heterozygotes
of
patients
with
cf
patients
and
parents
had
abnormal
trypsin
concentrations
we
found
that
in
only
out
of
the
patients
with
abnormal
irt
was
the
concentration
supranormal
our
data
suggest
that
low
irt
concentrations
are
an
excellent
index
of
diminished
pancreatic
reserve
in
cf
and
that
serum
irt
concentration
would
be
a
useful
diagnostic
test
the
fact
that
cf
patients
at
birth
invariably
have
very
high
irt
concentrations
which
fall
with
age
and
the
progress
of
the
disease
allied
with
the
fact
that
heterozygotes
have
high
concentrations
supports
the
previous
suggestion
that
an
uncontrolled
hypersecretion
of
zymogen
granules
is
the
basic
cellular
defect
in
cf
