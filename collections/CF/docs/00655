decreased
ouabain
binding
in
cystic
fibrosis
fibroblasts
in
potassium
free
medium
we
have
previously
demonstrated
that
cystic
fibrosis
cf
cells
show
increased
survival
compared
to
normal
cells
when
exposed
to
ouabain
in
medium
lacking
potassium
in
this
report
we
show
that
the
cf
cells
bind
significantly
less
ouabain
than
the
normal
cells
in
potassium
deficient
medium
using
age
matched
normal
and
cf
skin
fibroblast
strains
we
show
that
at
ouabain
concentrations
x
m
binding
for
both
normal
and
cf
cells
is
linear
with
time
for
h
and
reaches
equilibrium
after
h
at
ouabain
concentrations
between
and
x
m
the
initial
rate
of
binding
for
cf
cells
is
approx
of
the
normal
cells
under
equilibrium
binding
conditions
scatchard
analysis
reveals
that
three
different
cf
strains
have
and
fewer
ouabain
binding
sites
than
their
matched
normal
controls
in
addition
studies
in
potassium

of

flux
a
k
plus
analogue
into
the
cell
by
ouabain
show
no
differences
between
cf
and
normal
cells
we
have
also
previously
shown
that
in
a
low
glucose
potassium
deficient
medium
the
cf
cells
survived
ouabain
exposure
no
better
than
normal
cells
in
this
report
equilibrium
binding
studies
with
h
ouabain
clearly
show
that
cf
cells
bind
less
ouabain
under
these
conditions
than
normal
cells
these
results
indicate
that
ouabain
resistance
in
cf
cells
is
not
solely
a
function
of
differences
in
ouabain
binding
furthermore
the
differential
ouabain
killing
may
not
be
due
to
ion
transport
differences
but
rather
to
as
yet
unknown
mechanisms
cf
cells
thus
appear
to
be
unlike
previously
characterized
ouabain
resistant
mutants
