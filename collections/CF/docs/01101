the
effect
of
cimetidine
on
maldigestion
in
cystic
fibrosis
ten
patients
to
years
of
age
who
had
severe
pancreatic
exocrine
insufficiency
due
to
cystic
fibrosis
were
studied
to
determine
whether
cimetidine
would
improve
dietary
fat
and
nitrogen
absorption
when
a
constant
diet
was
consumed
and
oral
pancreatic
enzymes
were
administered
the
addition
of
cimetidine
or
mg
taken
orally
one
half
hour
before
meals
signficantly
reduced
fecal
fat
excretion
from
to
gm
hours
and
fecal
nitrogen
excretion
from
to
gm
hours
p
less
than
lower
doses
of
cimetidine
resulted
in
less
significant
reductions
of
steatorrhea
and
azotorrhea
cimetidine
may
be
a
useful
adjunct
to
oral
pancreatic
enzyme
therapy
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
who
continue
to
have
steatorrhea
and
azotorrhea
with
enzyme
therapy
alone
