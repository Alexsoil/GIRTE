glycosylation
of
vsv
glycoprotein
is
similar
in
cystic
fibrosis
heterozygous
carrier
and
normal
human
fibroblasts
the
single
envelope
glycoprotein
of
vesicular
stomatitis
virus
was
used
as
a
specific
probe
of
glycosyltransferase
activities
in
fibroblasts
from
two
cystic
fibrosis
patients
an
obligate
heterozygous
carrier
and
a
normal
individual
gel
filtration
of
pronase
digested
glycopeptides
from
both
purified
virions
and
infected
cell
associated
vsv
glycoprotein
which
had
been
labeled
with
h
glucosamine
did
not
reveal
any
significant
differences
in
the
glycosylation
patterns
between
the
different
cell
cultures
all
cell
lines
were
apparently
able
to
synthesize
the
mannose
and
glucosamine
containing
core
structure
and
branch
chains
terminating
in
sialic
acid
which
are
characteristic
of
asparagine
linked
carbohydrate
side
chains
in
cellular
glycoproteins
analysis
of
tryptic
glycopeptides
by
anion
exchange
chromotography
indicated
that
the
same
major
sites
on
the
virus
polypeptide
were
recognized
and
glycosylated
in
all
vsv
infected
cell
cultures
these
studies
suggest
that
the
basic
biochemical
defect
s
in
cystic
fibrosis
is
not
an
absence
or
deficiency
in
enzymes
responsible
for
the
biosynthesis
of
complex
carbohydrate
side
chains
