complement
components
in
cystic
fibrosis
dr
conover
and
his
colleagues
reported
no
difference
in
the
haemolytic
activity
of
serum
complement
components
c
c
of
cystic
fibrosis
c
f
patients
obligate
heterozygotes
and
normal
controls
they
also
measured
individual
complement
components
by
radial
immunodiffusion
and
found
a
significant
rise
of
c
but
no
significant
difference
in
c
levels
between
these
groups
using
immunodiffusion
kits
from
the
same
manufacturer
and
freshly
obtained
sera
we
have
observed
quite
different
findings
c
was
mildly
elevated
in
and
more
highly
elevated
in
of
c
f
patients
to
years
of
age
c
was
also
elevated
in
of
parents
of
c
f
patients
showing
mild
and
higher
elevations
while
of
controls
showed
only
mild
elevation
no
correlation
was
observed
between
serum
c
levels
and
the
age
sex
clinical
severity
of
disease
judged
by

scores
sputum
bacterial
colonisation
and
mode
of
treatment
of
the
c
f
patients
the
elevation
of
c
and
c
in
a
majority
of
patients
with
c
f
and
obligate
heterozygotes
is
very
interesting
and
is
suggestive
of
certain
genetic
defect

in
the
complement
activation
system
in
this
autosomal
recessive
disorder
