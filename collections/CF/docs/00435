relevance
of
cyclic
nucleotides
and
calcium
to
cystic
fibrosis
pp
the
general
area
of
research
at
the
biochemical
and
molecular
levels
related
to
cystic
fibrosis
has
suffered
from
the
lack
of
a
suitable
animal
model
although
some
animal
models
have
been
proposed
these
have
not
yet
been
tested
in
attempts
to
circumvent
this
problem
several
investigators
have
turned
to
cell
culture
techniques
to
study
various
aspects
of
cystic
fibrosis
these
studies
have
included
the
use
of
red
blood
cells
lymphocytes
skin
fibroblasts
and
cultured
nasal
polyps
there
are
enough
positive
indications
from
this
approach
to
indicate
that
it
might
be
fruitful
consequently
a
final
aspect
of
this
article
will
be
a
consideration
of
the
use
of
cell
cultures
for
future
investigations
into
the
possible
metabolic
lesions
in
cystic
fibrosis
control
of
cyclic
nucleotide
levels
in
parotid
the
role
of
calcium
microfilaments
and
microtubules
in
secretion
and
the
use
of
cell
cultures
as
an
approach
to
the
study
of
biochemical
defects
in
cystic
fibrosis
are
discussed
