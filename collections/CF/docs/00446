pp
cor
pulmonale
was
defined
by
a
committee
of
the
world
health
organization
as
right
ventricular
hypertrophy
secondary
to
disease
of
the
lung
parenchyma
or
pulmonary
vasculature
or
due
to
abnormalities
of
pulmonary
function
it
has
been
estimated
that
of
children
dying
with
cystic
fibrosis
have
cor
pulmonale
though
as
children
live
longer
the
number
may
be
higher
clinical
diagnosis
management
prognosis
echocardiography
echocardiography
as
a
measure
of
left
ventricular
dysfunction
and
a
study
of
ambulatory
and
hospitalized
cystic
fibrosis
patients
are
discussed
the
study
establishes
that
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
left
ventricular
dysfunction
and
hypertrophy
occur
and
are
related
to
increasing
severity
of
pulmonary
involvement
