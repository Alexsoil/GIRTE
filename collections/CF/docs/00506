hyperuricosuria

hyperuricosuria
developed
in

child

uric

hyperuricosuria
in
this
patient
and
two
other
children
was
directly
related
to
ingestion
of
large
amounts
of
pancreatic
extract
in
these
three
children
reducing
pancreatic
extract
dosage
by
percent
lowered
their
purine
intake
by
and

urinary
uric
acid
excretion
decreased
by
and
mg
overmedication
resulted
from
parents
decisions
to
increase
enzyme
dosages
in
our
cystic
fibrosis
clinic
of
patients
screened
at
random
were
taking
higher
than
the
prescribed
dose
of
pancreatic
enzymes
and
of
these
children
were
hyperuricosuric
on
the
basis
of
this
information
we
suggest
that
the
minimal
effective
dose
of
pancreatic
extract
should
be
determined
and
adhered
to
for
each
child
with
cystic
fibrosis
to
avoid
potential
renal
injury
from
hyperuricosuria
