amylase

patterns
were
evaluated
in

duodenal
fluid
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
and
normal
subjects
two
thirds
of
the
cf
patients
with
absent
pancreatic
enzymes
lacked
a
serum
pancreatic
isoamylase
band
while
the
remainder
had
a
markedly
diminished
pancreatic
band
when
compared
to
the
salivary
isoamylase
in
normal
sera
the
pancreatic
band
is
equal
to
or
greater
than
the
salivary
band
in
all
patients
with
absent
enzymes
the
diagnosis
of
abnormal
pancreatic
function
could
have
been
made
by
evaluation
of
serum
isoamylase
patterns
thereby
avoiding
duodenal
intubation
or
collection
of

stools
for
proteolytic
enzyme
activities
the
patients
with
normal
pancreatic

activities
had
normal

no
cf

a

total

amylase
levels
may
be
misleading
in
the
evaluation
of
pancreatic
function
since
the
amylase
may
be
of
salivary
origin
the
advantages
of
this
isoamylase
method
include
simplicity
and
noninvasiveness
requiring
only
a
