prevalence
of
mucoid
strains
of
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
in
bacteriological
specimens
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
and
patients
with
other
diseases
the
relative
prevalence
of
mucoid
strains
compared
with
non
mucoid
strains
of
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
has
been
investigated
in
all
routine
bacteriological
specimens
received
in
a
department
of
clinical
microbiology
during
pseudomonas
aeruginosa
was
isolated
from
of
the
specimens
per
cent
representing
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
isolates
and
patients
with
other
diseases
isolates
the
relative
prevalence
of
mucoid
strains
was
significantly
higher
in
specimens
from
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
per
cent
than
in
specimens
from
patients
with
other
diseases
per
cent
considering
patients
without
cystic
fibrosis
the
relative
prevalence
of
mucoid
strains
was
low
in
specimens
from
all
anatomical
regions
and
no
special
preference
of
these
strains
for
the
respiratory
tract
could
be
demonstrated
in
these
patients
in
contrast
to
the
situation
in
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
alternation
between
mucoid
strains
and
non
mucoid
strains
in
subsequent
specimens
was
observed
in
of
the
patients
