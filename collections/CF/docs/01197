an

of

isoproterenol
mg
increased
the
glycoprotein

fluid
from
control
rats
approximately
but
only
in
those
from
reserpine
treated
rats
by
contrast
pilocarpine
mg
administered
in
the

manner
caused
a
increase
in
the
total
protein
carbohydrate
and
lipid
content
of
lavage
samples
from
control
rats
and
increased
these

constituents
in
the
lavage
samples
of
reserpine
treated
rats
and
respectively
the
increased
total
carbohydrate
content
in
the
lavage
samples
of
the
treated
animals
was
not
associated
with
changes
in
the
percent

sialic
acid
the
ratio

components
did
not
change
in
the

rats
upon

with
either
pilocarpine

the
increased
total

content
fround
in
the

samples
from

probably
results
from
an
increase
in
phospholipids
a
decrease
in
phospholipid
content
occurred
in
the
lavage
samples
of
reserpine
treated
rats
upon
stimulation
while
the
opposite
was
observed
in
those
of
control
animals
chronic
treatment
of
rats
with
reserpine
thus
appears
to
induce
an
enhanced
production
of
glycoproteins
in
the
airways
and
to
interfere
with
phospholipid
metabolism
in
the
lung
in
addition
the
drug
treatment
enhances
the
secretory
response
to
pilocarpine
in
comparison
with
the
responses
of
control
animals
the
enhanced
response
or
hypersecretion
of
glycoproteins
is
a
quantitative
one
and
does
not
seem
to
involve
alterations
in
the
ratios
or
distribution
of
the
various
sugar
components
this
disturbance
in
the
secretory
function
of
the
respiratory
tract
a
target
organ
which
is
prominently
involved
in
cystic
fibrosis
cf
together
with
alterations
in
other
exocrine
glands
which
resemble
those
of
cf
patients
makes
the
reserpine
treated
rat
a
useful
model
for
further
study
of
possible
pathogenetic
mechanisms
in
cf
the
experimental
animal
model
for
cf
developed
by
the
chronic
administration
of
reserpine
to
rats
has
been
found
to
have
changes
in
the
protein
content
of
lung
lavage
samples
in
addition
to
morphologic
and
secretory
alterations
in
the
salivary
glands
and
the
pancreas
further
analysis
of
the
organic
composition
of
lung
lavage
samples
shows
that
the
protein
carbohydrate
and
lipid
contents
are
significantly
increased
after
chronic
reserpine
administration
and
that
the
response
to
stimulation
with
pilocarpine
is
enhanced
in
the
treated
animals
when
compared
to
that
of
untreated
control
rats
it
therefore
appears
that
chronic
reserpine
administration
causes
a
hypersecretion
of
glycoproteins
and
changes
in
lipid
metabolism
in
the
respiratory
tract
of
the
rat
and
that
in
conjunction
with
previous
findings
in
other
exocrine
glands
these
effects
on
lung
function
make
the
reserpine
treated
rat
a
useful
tool
for
the
study
of
the
pathologic
disturbance
seen
in
the
major
exocrine
glands
