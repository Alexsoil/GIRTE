immunological
studies
in
cystic
fibrosis
evidence
is
presented
to
support
the
concept
that
much
of
the
allergy
in
cystic
fibrosis
cf
is
ige
mediated
total
ige
levels
were
higher
in
allergic
than
in
nonallergic
cf
patients
levels
were
also
higher
in
those
patients
who
had
had
the
greatest
number
of
chest
infections
in
the
preceding
months
ige
antibody
levels
to
dermatophagoides
pteronyssinus
timothy
grass
pollen
and
aspergillus
fumigatus
were
higher
in
those
with
positive
results
from
skin
tests
to
these
allergens
the
serum
igg
igm
and
iga
levels
of
allergic
and
nonallergic
cf
patients
did
not
differ
but
the
overall
mean
values
for
igg
and
igm
were
higher
than
those
reported
for
healthy
british
children
the
highest
levels
tended
to
be
present
in
patients
with
the
greatest
number
of
recent
major
chest
infections
and
the
difference
was
significant
for
igg
patients
had
iga
levels
sd
below
the
reported
means
for
age
matched
controls
and
of
these
were
nonallergic
iga
levels
were
also
higher
in
patients
who
had
recently
experienced
major
chest
infections
of
the
patients
were
tissue
types
for
hla
a
and
b
antigens
but
no
significant
clinical
associations
with
single
antigens
were
observed
the
antigen
phenotype
a
b
was
more
common
in
patients
with
multiple
allergic
symptoms
than
in
those
with
a
single
allergy
or
merely
a
positive
result
from
a
skin
test
nonsignificant
increases
of
w
in
patients
with
frequent
infections
and
of
a
in
patients
presenting
with
meconium
ileus
were
also
noted
the
data
presented
do
not
permit
a
choice
to
be
made
between
the
alternative
concepts
of
allergy
as
a
primary
abnormality
in
cf
and
allergy
arising
secondary
to
infection
