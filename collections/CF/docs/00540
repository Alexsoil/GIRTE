a
therapeutic
trial
of
fatty
acid
supplementation
in
cystic
fibrosis
seven
children
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
have
been
treated
for
at
least
one
year
with
intravenously
administered
soya
oil
emulsion
in
all
an
improvement
of
at
least
one
biochemical
abnormality
in
character
with
the
disease
appeared
the
children
s
clinical
course
remains
benign
this
course
is
remarkably
better
than
that
of
other
children
with
cf
treated
without
intralipid
in
auckland
in
the
same
period
though
a
placebo
effect
cannot
be
discounted
it
is
postulated
that
intravenous
supplementation
with
essential
fatty
acid
in
cf
may
in
turn
partially
correct
an
error
of
metabolism
of
prostaglandins
present
in
the
disease
