assisted
ventilation
for
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
forty
six
patients
with
cystic
fibrosis
cf
month
to
years
of
age
had
episodes
of
assisted
ventilation
thirty
five
died
after
to
days
of
mechanical
ventilation
and
six
others
died
in
the
hospital
to
days
after
assisted
ventilation
therapy
was
discontinued
only
three
patients
survived
longer
than
one
year
after
discharge
these
results
are
much
poorer
than
those
reported
for
patients
with
chronic
obstructive
pulmonary
disease
of
other
causes
probably
because
of
the
different
natural
history
and
response
to
therapy
in
cf
patients
with
cf
whose
conditions
progressively
deteriorated
despite
optimal
therapy
and
no
longer
respond
to
antibiotic
and
physical
therapy
are
not
good
candidates
for
mechanical
ventilation
the
occasional
patient
with
good
baseline
status
in
whom
acute
respiratory
failure
develops
should
be
considered
for
assisted
ventilation
