essential
fatty
acids
in
cystic
fibrosis
in
three
literature
reports
the
linoleic
acid
l
a
levels
for
cystic
fibrosis
c
f
compared
to
controls
are
always
more
significantly
lower
than
arachidonic
acid
a
a
similarly
the
percentage
lowering
is
also
more
for
l
a
than
a
a
there
is
thus
no
overwhelming
evidence
for
a
blocked
or
absent
desaturase
and
the
cause
of
the
e
f
a
deficiency
must
be
elsewhere
we
have
found
up
to
of
the
total
fatty
acids
in
both
serum
and
red
cells
to
be
c
omega
all
of
our
c
f
patients
have
shown
this
acid
at
some
stage
and
for
most
it
is
a
permanent
feature
of
their
fatty
acid
profile
it
has
been
reported
that
c
omega
would
probably
act
as
an
inhibitor
of
prostaglandin
formation
from
a
a
and
it
is
interesting
to
conjecture
on
whether
this
could
account
for
some
of
the
symptoms
of
c
f
c
omega
would
also
be
incorporated
into
p
i
and
could
then
alter
membrane
properties
