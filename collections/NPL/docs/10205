CONNECTED
AMPLIFIERS
A
FORMULA
IS
DERIVED
FOR
THE
NOISE
TEMPERATURE
OF
A
CASCADE
CONNECTED
AMPLIFIER
WITH
NEGATIVE
CONDUCTANCES
AS
ACTIVE
ELEMENTS
THIS
PERMITS
A
SIMPLE
GRAPHICAL
REPRESENTATION
OF
NOISE
CHARACTERISTICS
EXAMPLES
ARE
GIVEN
OF
PARAMETRIC
AMPLIFIER
STAGES
AND
THE
INFLUENCE
OF
ISOLATORS
AND
CIRCULATORS
ON
NOISE
TEMPERATURE
AND
BANDWIDTH
IS
DISCUSSED
