THE
REFLECTION
OF
ELECTROMAGNETIC
WAVES
AT
A
PLANE
METAL
SURFACE
COVERED
WITH
AN
ABSORBING
LAYER
THE
REFLECTION
COEFFICIENT
IS
CALCULATED
AS
A
FUNCTION
OF
FOR
AN

INCIDENT
PERPENDICULARLY
ON
A
THIN
ABSORPTION
LAYER
NUMERICAL
AND
GRAPHICAL
METHODS
ARE
GIVEN
FOR
THE
EVALUATION
OF
LAYER

WHICH
MAKE
THE

COEFFICIENT
AS

AS
POSSIBLE
OVER
A
WIDE
