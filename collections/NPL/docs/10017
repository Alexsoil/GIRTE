A
CONSIDERATION
OF
THE
ELECTRON
DISAPPEARANCE
IN
THE
LAYER
OF
THE
IONOSPHERE
FACTORS
INFLUENCING
THE
ELECTRON
CONCENTRATION
AND
CONVENTIONAL
THEORIES
OF
RECOMBINATION
AND
ATTACHMENT
ARE
REVIEWED
NOCTURNAL
DIFFUSION
CAN
ACCOUNT
FOR
ONLY
A
SMALL
VARIATION
OF
CONCENTRATION
BUT
ITS
EFFECT
ON
THE
ALTITUDE
OF
MAXIMUM
CONCENTRATION
IS
NOT
NECESSARILY
NEGLIGIBLE
STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS
INDICATES
THAT
THE
INFLUENCE
OF
PRESSURE
ON
THE
NOCTURNAL
VARIATION
OF
ELECTRON
CONCENTRATION
IS
UNEXPECTEDLY
SMALL
WHILE
THAT
OF
TEMPERATURE
IS
LARGE
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
MONTHLY
MEAN
VALUES
INDICATES
THAT
ATTACHMENT
RATHER
THAN
RECOMBINATION
IS
THE
MECHANISM
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
ELECTRON
DISAPPEARANCE
THE
INFLUENCE
OF
LAYER
MOVEMENTS
THOUGH
NOT
LARGE
IS
SIGNIFICANT
FURTHER
EVIDENCE
IN
FAVOUR
OF
THE
ATTACHMENT
THEORY
IS
OBTAINED
FROM
CONSIDERATION
OF
DISTRIBUTION
AND
FROM
A
COMPARISON
OF
THE
NOCTURNAL
CONCENTRATION
VARIATIONS
AT
TWO
SITES
THEORETICAL
CONSIDERATIONS
FAVOUR
A
PROCESS
OF
ELECTRON
REMOVAL
IN
WHICH
COLLISIONS
BETWEEN
ATOMIC
IONS
OF
OXYGEN
AND
EXCITED
MOLECULES
OF
NITROGEN
PRODUCE
MOLECULAR
IONS
OF
NITROGEN
WHICH
IN
TURN
RECOMBINE
WITH
ELECTRONS
