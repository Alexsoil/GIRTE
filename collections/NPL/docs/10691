THEORY
AN
IDEALIZED
PROBLEM
IS
SOLVED
A
CYLINDRICAL
SHEET
OF
NEUTRAL
IONIZED
GAS
IS
PROJECTED
INTO
A
MAGNETIC
FIELD
WHICH
IS
ALIGNED
ALONG
THE
CYLINDER
AXIS
AND
VARIES
AS
WHERE
IS
THE
DISTANCE
FROM
THE
AXIS
FOR
A
MAGNETIC
FIELD
COMPARABLE
IN
MAGNITUDE
WITH
THAT
OF
THE
EARTH
THE
SHEET
WOULD
BE
STOPPED
AT
