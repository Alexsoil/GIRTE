MAGNETIC
EFFECTS
IN
A
PLASMA
COLUMN
IRRADIATED
WITH
MICROWAVES
THE
RADIUS
OF
GYRATION
OF
A
PLASMA
COLUMN
IS
DETERMINED
BY
IMPARTING
A
COHERENT
CIRCULAR
ORBITAL
MOTION
TO
THE
ELECTRONS
IN
THE
COLUMN
AT
ITS
PRINCIPAL
RESONANCE
FREQUENCY
THIS
IS
ACCOMPLISHED
BY
IRRADIATING
THE
COLUMN
WITH
TWO
INCOMING
WAVES
OF
THE
SAME
FREQUENCY
BUT
OUT
OF
PHASE
WHEN
THE
ELECTRIC
FIELDS
ARE
CORRECTLY
ALIGNED
A
MAGNETIC
MOMENT
IS
DEVELOPED
