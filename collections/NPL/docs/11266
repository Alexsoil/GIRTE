THE
RELATION
OF
MAGNETIC
MICROPULSATIONS
TO
ELECTRIC
CURRENT
AND
SPACE
CHARGE
SYSTEMS
IN
THE
LOWER
IONOSPHERE
FROM
OBSERVATIONS
MADE
IN
USING
A
LARGE
WIRE
LOOP
THEORY
IS
DEVELOPED
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
MICROPULSATIONS
IN
THE
RANGE
ARE
ASSOCIATED
WITH
ABSORPTION
OF
AURORAL
PARTICLES
IN
THE
IONOSPHERE
AND
IN
THE
RANGE
ARE
THE
RESULT
OF
THE
ABSORPTION
AND
REFLECTION
OF
HYDROMAGNETIC
WAVES
IN
THE
LOWER
IONOSPHERE
