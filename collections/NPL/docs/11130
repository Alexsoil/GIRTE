HYDROMAGNETIC
INTERPRETATION
OF
SUDDEN
COMMENCEMENTS
OF
MAGNETIC
STORMS
A
MODEL
IS
PROPOSED
IN
WHICH
THE
IMPACT
OF
SOLAR
PLASMA
ON
THE
GEOMAGNETIC
FIELD
GENERATES
A
SHOCK
WAVE
THE
COMPRESSIONAL
SHOCK
WAVE
PROPAGATES
TO
THE
EARTH
AS
A
LONGITUDINAL
HYDROMAGNETIC
WAVE
IN
LOW
LATITUDES
AND
GENERATES
TRANSVERSE
HYDROMAGNETIC
WAVES
IN
THE
EXOSPHERE
WHICH
PROPAGATE
TO
HIGH
LATITUDES
ALONG
THE
FIELD
LINES
A
REVERSED
IMPULSE
AT
LATITUDES
ABOVE
IS
EXPLAINED
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
DIRECTION
OF
THE
MAGNETIC
PERTURBATION
VECTOR
AT
THE
TOP
OF
THE
IONOSPHERE
